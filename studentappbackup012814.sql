One of the goals of DTLA is to organize our communities for the passage of humane immigration laws.  In the one year he\'s been involved with DTLA, he\'s been one of the most committed members to the organization and immigrant rights movement.  I see him at almost every meeting, action, training, press conference, and/or event.  You name it he\'s there ready to contribute his energy and passion.',4,'From volunteering with Luis for DTLA, I\'ve gotten to know him better.  I learned that Luis is still gaining experience in how to work with groups and as a team.  I feel that for him growing up and the job he worked for most of his life, repairing motorized items and re-selling them at swap-meet, he became very accustomed to working very independent.  I think that he can problem solve well on his own, but is still learning how to problem solve as being part of a group.  When disagreements come up at DTLA, he does offer suggestions to help resolve the disagreement.',4,'Similar to the previous question, I think Luis has grown tremendously in being more patient at DTLA when obstacles arrive.  From the moment he arrived to the organization he was always one of the first ones to jump and want to take action, without fully thinking out a strategic plan.  However this past December the organization planned and executed an action.  Luis was assigned a critical piece at the beginning of the event, the press conference. He knew he had to figure out some things to make it work.  He reached out to be before the day of the event where I helped him brainstorm potential options.  Even though the beginning ended up changing due to location, I don\'t think Luis would have the patience and skill to have asked me for help and brainstorm possible solutions.',4,'Since the moment I met Luis, he\'s been eager to help.  He always offer a hand with whatever needs to be done.  At the moment Luis to me is more in the stage of learning how to be part of a group and is benefiting from the mentorship of various individuals within DTLA.  However from my interactions with him, he is very willing to teach and mentor others.  I noticed this when I dropped him off at home 1 day and he showed me all the different motorized equipment he\'s helped repair and re-sell with his dad at the swapmeet.  I asked him how he did all this.  He explained how he learned disassemble, identify whats wrong with the item, repair, and then reassemble it for sale.  Luis learned all this informally through his dad.  He was definitely eager to explain and show me all the things he\'s worked on.',5,'Luis is an extremely curious person as described from his mechanic skills. Regarding curiosity over the structure and groups of organizations, Luis is just as eager to learn about this too.  Whenever I get the chance to talk to him one-on-one I ask him, \"how do you think DTLA can improve, how can we grow?\"  He\'s always quick to say that we need to start getting out in the community and start engaging them in conversations around the immigration issues so that \"they can get involved too.\"  Again he\'s still learning this aspect of organizing and at times he might be a bit rushed to want to move on things, but it\'s always driven by his passion to improve his comunity.',5,'Luis will ask for help when he knows he needs some guidance.  From one of the previous questions he organized me to help him with planning and executing his assignment for the December action.','One specific challenge that I\'ve touched upon in previous answers is that Luis is still adapting to working with others.  He\'s come a long way in the past as I\'ve seen his growth.   Luis is also still adapting to the realization that work encompasses not only physical work, but also cerebral.  At times from conversations with him, he would express that if he wasn\'t \"doing something\" he wasn\'t contributing/working, even though he participates in planning meetings and other discussions.  I feel this is changing now, but Luis is still in the process of fully learning this idea.','I can\'t emphasize enough how much Luis has grown in the past year as a volunteer with DTLA.  Luis\' energy, passion and guts to try new things, even when things don\'t go as planned, is what makes all of us at DTLA fond and supportive of him.  Even after he takes some some falls, he continues to roll with the punches and gets back up to finish the task at hand.  Luis would benefit greatly from having a steady mentor/group of mentors to continue having thought provoking conversations and providing him constructive feedback.  I would love to see Luis be accepted into the program because he would benefit greatly from a plunger term program where he will receive continuous training and follow-up. If there is anything else I can provide and do to help him enter the program then please feel free to call me at my cell 213-276-3376.  Luis has a huge heart and tremendous potential to contribute  not just to the immigrants rights movement but to all movements.

Also, facilitate a space for her to engage with community organizations to think about and strategically build power within marginalized communities utilizing power structure analysis.',1,NULL),(478,174,95,5,'I worked with Wendy mainly at the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at the Ohio State University, where I was deputy director and Wendy was employed first as a summer intern and then as a graduate assistant. However, even before Wendy came to Kirwan I knew her (and her husband) casually as committed activists working on behalf of undocumented immigrants and others in Columbus and Ohio, and internationally. At Kirwan - which, as the full name suggests, our work was entirely devoted to racial justice and equity - she worked in our Global Justice program, much of the time on an ambitious project intended to shed needed light and analysis on the global politics of the food crisis on the continent of Africa. Racial, economic and gender justice were all central to this work and perhaps one way to underline Wendy\'s commitment to those issues is to note that while we could only pay her for 20 hours she often worked twice that many weekly. We literally had to urge her to go home, to attend to her academic and other work.   ',5,'The Global Justice program referred to above, and the main project of illuminating the food crisis in Africa, was essentially the work of two people - Wendy and her supervisor, Elsadig Elsheikh. The two main thrusts of the work, which Wendy and Sadig came up with on their own, were, first, a feature length film that would focus on  key aspects of the problem, including the the largely-destructive (e.g., \"land grabs\") work of multinational corporations in perhaps 3-5 countries in Africa, and feature the voices of the community members and advocates working on these issues locally; and, second, a cutting-edge \"transmedia\" web site that would allow those locals to continue telling their truths and reporting on the story, while giving visitors to the site an extraordinary, multi-dimensional experience of the problem, the people, and possible prescriptions. On their own initiative, without any meaningful assistance from the Institute, by the time I left Wendy and Sadig had managed to create an incredible international network of supportive scholars, researchers, academics and community folks ready to contribute to this work. They also secured the services of Stephanie Black, the  wonderful director of the documentary about Jamaica, Life and Debt. Stephanie in turn secured the commitment of a topnotch film crew. For a university-based research institute like Kirwan to be involved in such a project was, as far as any of us every found out, literally unprecedented. \"Creative\" doesn\'t begin to describe the genius of the project. Wendy was one of the two architects of that work.',5,'\"Patience\" isn\'t necessarily the word I would choose. I think of King\'s Letter from Birmingham Jail and his response to the white clergy who urged him to be patient. Wendy\'s commitment to righting the wrongs she chooses to engage is complete. I mentioned her husband in an earlier response because her depth commitment is such that I imagine she could not follow her devotion to the extent that she has, including her application for your program and all it would mean for her future, without a similarly committed partner (given that she has a partner). Her COMMITMENT, not her \"patience,\" means that she takes the time and devotes the personal resources needed to works thru obstacles that impede her path forward. Her application to your program is a great case in point. The plug was pulled on the program she and Sadig launched by an incoming executive director lacking in vision who didn\'t even take the time to learn what they were doing. Now, Wendy is looking to gain the skills to do much of the programming for the crucial web site element herself. She does this not because she is necessarily a \"techie,\" though I think she has picked up good number-crunching and GIS skills during her graduate work. She does it because she believes acquiring these high level skills will best serve the work she wants to do. That\'s commitment. And like all commitment to hard work on seemingly intractable issues, it demands a \'patience\' I believe Wendy has in abundance. ',4,'Wendy\'s generosity and great-heartedness, the way she moves thru the world  - given what I do know of her I truly would be shocked if she didn\'t have an interest, a demonstrated interest, in mentoring and teaching. Unfortunately, teaching and mentoring were not required of her role at Kirwan and she was granted no opportunity to teach/mentor given that her core team comprised just one other person and that, nominally, she was the \"junior\" member of that team. I give her a 4 because I can\'t honestly say one way or another except by inference from what I do know of her. ',5,'I believe Wendy\'s deep curiosity is less about what makes people tick, per se, and more about how things work, where \'things\' are understood to include such phenomena such as the food crisis in Africa, the mechanisms that erode the human rights and civil liberties of undocumented immigrants to the US, and so on. This returns to my point above about the astonishing depth of her commitment to the issues she cares about. Wendy is \'curious\' about the dynamics she needs to understand to help ensure progress on the work she wants to move.  At least in context of Kirwan and its typically structural and systemic approaches to analysis, curiosity about what \"makes people tick\" was perhaps more often associated with interpersonal \"drama\" than with social problem-solving. If you accept Wendy to your program, and I SINCERELY hope you do, you will be delighted to find few less prone to personal drama or to exacerbating the drama of others, than Wendy. ',4,'I give Wendy a 4 rather than a 5 here because, while she is very willing to ask for help, she can at times be even more willing to put in the personal hard work needed to find an answer that might have been more quickly discovered by asking a question of the right person. This is a function of two priceless qualities - Wendy\'s willingness to work very hard to command the skills/knowledge she believes she needs, as just noted, and a gracious reluctance to \'impose\' her needs on others. Arrogance plays no part in the explanation. I also want the emphasize that I found Wendy quite willing to ask questions - of Sadig, of me, of others. However, given that she was engaged in a remarkably innovative project on a spectacularly complex (even \"wicked\") social/political/environmental/sociological/economic/racial/gendered challenge under conditions of significant resource scarcity, I found it useful to assure Wendy that asking more rather than fewer questions, of me and others, would serve all our interests. And she responded very well to that encouragement.','The only piece that comes to mind - and I have no idea how you would handle it; perhaps I shouldn\'t even mention it - is Wendy\'s health. I\'ve never known her to miss time for health-related reasons but I also know that she has had some significant  health problems. Given her inclination not to impose \'her problems\' even on friends, I would ask you to keep even this vaguely-presented backdrop in mind. ','First, in case my feeling about Wendy hasn\'t come thru clearly enough: Wendy Ake is a GEM of a human being. A spectacular gem of an activist, a researcher, an advocate, and a person. You will LOVE her. PLEASE accept her to Code for Progress so you can discover her for yourself. She is a spectacular talent and will do you proud! My only thought about supporting Wendy follows from what I have said already. Wendy is smart, passionate, committed to her work. She is also quiet - more inclined to listen than to speak, certainly, and, while very friendly, somewhat self-contained. Still waters..., as they say. Because she is not as extroverted as many, and because she hesitates to \'burden\' anyone, you may find it helpful to draw her out.

Michael was brought in by one of my good friends Lucas de Silva, who has also worked with PICO, and is a very passionate and driven immigrant rights activist in Central Florida and now DC. One of my first conversations with Michael was an enlightening one and you can in the way that he speaks that he was very affected by the plights and struggles of undocumented immigrants in America, despite his lack of experience as an undocumented immigrant. But I believe, coming from a family of immigrants, and living in a community of immigrants, he is still able to see the importance of this issue and the need to help undocumented immigrants gain justice in such a charged human rights issue. Along with that, he also sees the connectivity of immigrant rights to other issues of racial, gender, and economic justice. He believes that at the end of the day, the immigrant rights movement goes beyond just undocumented immigrants. There\'s a whole big world of issues and disadvantaged people, and they are all intertwined in one way or another. And he sees the importance of recognizing and finding solutions for bringing about awareness of all of them.

He has a genuine interest in leading people and learning as much as he can so that he can turn around and teach people.

I don\'t think there has been a time where I\'ve seen him where he didn\'t have a story about something that has happened to him or someone that he has interacted with somehow, that he didn\'t follow-up with an attempt to understand the reasoning behind it. A couple of weeks after I met him, he was recently hired to work at a new job. And the whole hiring process was a peculiar one that he constantly tried to reason over the days following.

Additionally, she recently founded \"Comadres who Code,\" the aim of which is two-fold: to create an intentional space for hispanic women in the tech space to learn from and teach one another about tech, with the hopes of a brighter, independent future. She also hopes to direct the group to work on issues that latinos face here in the US, and how to connect US knowledge and expertise with folks in Central America.',5,'There\'s a look that comes across Krystal\'s face when she\'s hit by a solution...\"Wait!\" she\'ll cry. \"What if we did (X),\" her voice rising with excitement as the answer we\'ve been searching for pops out of her mouth. She almost always seems shocked by her own genius, like she\'s not yet realized how creative she is. Krystal and i talked for a long time about the kind of organization we wanted to build together; I remember last February sitting at table after table, laptops and cafes con leche at hand, trying to write the founding documents for our 501c3. Thoughts, ideals, motivations, even colors swirled around in discussion after discussion, and it was Krystal, who asking one question that seems off base, or turning the discussion in an expected direction, or finally, trying out a game she found online or from among her many databases of resources, she was able to pull out from the tangle of thoughts and words some articulations that not only made sense but defined who we are.

I wish I had an ounce of the patience she has when we hit the hard stuff; it\'s been a bumpy ride over the last year since we\'ve decided to make our start-up non-profit a reality. Krystal looks at the long game, reminds me of what we\'ve accomplished, is willing to take a hard look at what went wrong and how we can improve.

She is SO excited to learn new things, and in this byzantine realm of circumvention and cryptography, she is so keen to understand not only how the tools work, but also to learn about the people who made them and how they work.

Krystal not only helped this group of women improve their business and marketing processes and outcomes, but also empowered them through leadership and self esteem courses. She still returns to El Salvador on a regular basis to follow-up with these amazing women and continue seeing through the work that she started. ',5,'Krystal is incredibly creative and resourceful. One example of this is the English for tourism and professional development pr she developed for youth in rural El Salvador with very little financial or material resources at her disposal. In spite of this lack of resources Krystal was able to create an invaluable professional development course for at risk youth that enabled them to gain English language and customer service skills that made them highly competitive in the local tourist economy. Krystal also solicited donations and resources from friends and family back home, local businesses, and the US Embassy to fund a trip for the youth from her community to visit a 5 star hotel in San Salvador and interview and shadow professional tourism service employees. Her creativity in creating this ground breaking program led to tangible positive changes in the professional outlook of these youth.',5,'Krystal is both dedicated and patient and never gives up.

Krystal pushed through these challenges, however and found the members of the association her were willing to put aside differences, put in some extra effort and find the common ground within the group to move forward. She specifically targeted the women in the group who, though less vocal and active on the surface, were far more creative and able to quell conflict before it got out of control.',5,'I would refer to my earlier example of the professional development course she developed in her Peace Corps community in rural El Salvador. She was an incredible mentor to the youth of her community and helped them to develop professional skills that would make them competitive in the burgeoning tourism industry of Northern Morazan. She sees the often undiscovered potential in others and nourishes it with realistic and down to earth encouragement. She\'s not afraid to use tough love when necessary.

She spent countless meetings and conversations with me trying to determine what made her association members tick, what they had in common, who the natural leaders were, who had the power to bring the group together, what kind of projects that would bring out the groups collective skill sets, etc. She used her curiosity and investigative skills to develop strategies to improve association business processes, strengthen relationships with association members and work towards fostering a more cohesive group. She is also very curios about the world of development in general and is constantly up to date on the newest development theories and models.',5,'Krystal is not afraid to ask for help and is willing to admit failure and set-backs on projects or her life in general. At certain points during Krystal\'s Peace Corps service, she came to me to seek support in teaching her youth professional development course, to vent about her concerns and stress related to the tourism association and about the challenges of Peace Corps and life in general. Rather than just stubbornly pushing through and keeping her emotions bottled up, Krystal lets it out when needed, seeks help and input from her friends, mentors and allies and use the help to center herself and refocus on her goals. ','Krystal\'s incredible passion for social justice and helping others has often put her at odds with her family, many of whom would prefer that Krystal get a reliable and secure 9-5 job in Washington, D.C. that pays the bills and provides her with a safe and stable life. Her family often tells her that she already did her part in helping others by serving in Peace Corps and that now it\'s time to help her self. For Krystal, Peace Corps was just the beginning and it exposed her to the stark economic, health related and political realities of the under served populations living in the developing world.

',4,'As a first generation US college student, Rommy learned the ropes of college life with limited assistance.  Furthermore, her status as undocumented created extraneous barriers and challenges.  One of the issues for her as she attended UF was the lack of information shared with Hispanic youth, especially those with undocumented status. Instead of allowing others like her go through the same hardship, Rommy and a friend decided to take manners into thier own hands and designed and developed, “The DREAMer Manual: A Guide To Surviving the Swamp!” This resource guide offered a significant amount of services and advice to smooth the transition to college for undocumented and first-generation students at the University of Florida.  In addition, before Rommy graduated she provided Photoshop tutorials and public relations workshops to underclassmen of CHISPAS. ',5,'I watched Rommy build a coalition of advocates and educate them about the issues of both immigration and queer rights. We have had many long conversations about these issues, so I can say that she is inquisitive, energized by the findings and really thrives on challenges. She is also very creative--loves to create and explore other facets of her artwork and will figure out new ways of adapting to challenges. I think back to her creation of the t-shirts to promote the struggle of those who are undocumented- figuring out how to make the stencils and what materials or inks would work the best.  She has embraced that sense of inquisitiveness into her work with her graphic design and also her non-profit work.',5,'Rommy often came to me to discuss various issues while she was creating the student resource guide for undocumented students, as well as various projects for her clients.  She often would discuss with me how to set up documents for pre-press and suggested layouts to produce documents to assure their best outcome. She is very comfortable asking for advice and welcomes the opportunity to advance her techniques and her goals.\r\n','Although Rommy is very capable of handling obstacles, her lack of recognizing her own talent and level of capacity tends to limit her advancement. With that said, her accomplishments still outweigh that of most of her peers. The skills and mentoring that Rommy will receive from this program would enhance her grassroots organizing skills around issues of status and being queer and help her gain even more confidence in the value and power of her work. ','I believe that the recognition of her abilities, by being accepted into this program, will be a tremendous boost to her self-esteem.   She is an amazing person with a great deal of compassion and empathy and her acceptance into this program will certainly offer her that additional sense of confidence. She is an intelligent, insightful person and by offering her the guidance and technical skills to advance, her commitments will only increase the scope of her work and the immense influence that her art and technical skills has on her community.',1,NULL),(412,239,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(413,178,11,4,'Michelle is committed in achieving justice for all communities and understands the intersectionality of struggles.

Her organizing and personal frame work is about trying something new and seeing how it can work best.',5,'Michelle has shown her dedication and patience especially with maintaining ASPIRE LA. When ASPIRE LA was still an student organization at UCLA, Michelle was leading the effort to ensure the API undocumented students knew there was a space for them. Her challenge at the time was ensuring people stayed in the spaces and the organization grow--it was a difficult task to do but she maintained her patience knowing the need for the spaces. She has helped it grow and transition out to a community based organization.

',1,NULL),(415,230,11,5,'Under my supervision, Michelle interned at Asian Pacific AIDS Intervention Team (APAIT) in 2013 through a program called Dream Summer, which placed young Asian and Pacific Islander (API) immigrants at API-serving organizations. Michelle’s commitment to social justice—including racial, gender, and economic justice—is apparent through her involvement in the immigrant rights movement. Although she came to her internship to learn, she taught me the importance of bringing an activist’s perspective to community organizations. During her internship, her responsibilities included keeping up to date with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and creating informative materials about the ACA for the community. After learning that undocumented immigrants were not included in ACA measures, Michelle committed herself to learning about health resources that were available for the undocumented. Additionally, Michelle focused on understanding how the ACA would impact young immigrants eligible for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), an issue which had yet to be clarified by the California state government during her internship.',5,'Michelle was asked to design print materials that would provide basic information about the ACA to APAIT’s clients and communities. I had expected her to put together a simple fact sheet, but Michelle went above and beyond, demonstrating her creativity in problem solving by designing an eye-catching infographic that displayed information in an easy-to-understand format. Furthermore, she designed a separate flow chart that aided clients in determining their eligibility for different health coverage programs. Michelle also demonstrated her ability to think on her feet when confronted with challenges while conducting outreach and education on the ACA at community events (e.g., dealing with difficult questions from community members, logistical concerns, etc.).',5,'In general, Michelle demonstrated patience in working through obstacles through her work ethic and positive attitude. Specifically, while assisting APAIT’s development team with a grant application, Michelle displayed patience and perseverance in overcoming challenges. Michelle had never worked on a grant application before, so she requested to review samples of similar, previously submitted grant applications and met with me multiple times to ask questions. She also thoroughly researched the funder, grant application process, and background information on APAIT and HIV/AIDS. Michelle wrote multiple drafts of her portion of the grant application and requested two rounds of edits to ensure that she was writing a clear, concise, and convincing narrative. With Michelle’s help and determination to get it right, the development team submitted the grant application and was successfully funded.',4,'Michelle worked on APAIT’s outreach and education project, which involved educating API communities about new health coverage options available under the ACA in California. As part of this project, she led educational group workshops and conducted one-on-one education with individuals at community events. She demonstrated not only interest in teaching others, but also resolve and patience in ensuring that she answered consumers’ questions and imparted crucial information. Occasionally, she dealt with difficult consumers and remained professional, referring consumers to resources (e.g., websites, community organizations) if she did not have the answers to their questions. Other than in this context, I did not have a chance to observe Michelle’s interest in mentoring others, but I believe that she would make an excellent mentor based on her performance during her internship.',5,'Michelle had limited familiarity with the health care system when she started her internship. She threw herself wholeheartedly into researching health care reform and, in doing so, gained a deep understanding of health insurance, coverage options, public health programs and funding streams, and the impact of the ACA. In the first few weeks of her internship, Michelle often asked me questions about the health care system, but by the end of her internship, she was APAIT’s accepted expert on the ACA and informed me of new developments in ACA implementation. She also used her expertise to design easy-to-understand materials on health coverage options for the public. Considering the complexity of the U.S. health care system, I believe that this is an outstanding example of Michelle’s curiosity around how things work and her determination to figure it out. She also demonstrated her curiosity in smaller ways, such as asking me questions about APAIT’s organizational structure and programs.',5,'Michelle is an effective independent worker, but she is always willing to ask for help when needed. She brought a willingness to learn and a collaborative attitude to her internship. For example, Michelle was responsible for delivering educational workshop presentations about the ACA to multiple audiences (e.g., staff, clients, API community). At her request, I reviewed her PowerPoint presentation multiple times, providing suggestions to tweak the presentation to different audiences. Michelle was very receptive to feedback, and she also held practice presentations to ensure that she was fully prepared. Michelle brought this approach to other projects she worked on during her internship as well.','As an undocumented immigrant, Michelle has overcome many barriers to achieve all that she has, as well as demonstrated courage through activism. In the API community, there is significant stigma against speaking out as an undocumented immigrant due to cultural factors (e.g., saving face, belief in keeping private matters in the family) and fear of deportation. As such, Michelle demonstrates courage and resilience every day by identifying as undocumented and participating in the immigrant rights movement. Please keep in mind how being undocumented influences Michelle’s experience (even though she was granted deferred action). For example, having not had the privilege to speak out in public for most of her life, Michelle initially lacked confidence in her public speaking ability. To overcome this, she practiced her workshop presentations repeatedly, and her confidence increased noticeably. Also, she was asked by the Dream Summer program to deliver a speech at their closing event. Michelle often exceeded my expectations during her internship, but this was when I was proudest of her—watching her share her personal story with such confidence to a room of more than 50 people. Therefore, keep in mind that though there may be areas in which Michelle has not been able to gain as much experience as her peers due to her status, she will work twice as hard to overcome barriers to her success.','When approaching new situations or tasks, Michelle responds well to dividing tasks into measurable steps. With the public speaking example, Michelle overcame her lack of experience and gained confidence by designing the PowerPoint presentation, delivering practice presentations and receiving feedback, and integrating feedback into her final product. She took a similar approach to the grant application by looking at previous examples and going through multiple rounds of editing. As such, Michelle benefits from close collaboration with her supervisor and/or team to help her lay out steps to accomplishing a new task as well as provide feedback to help her refine her product or result.',1,NULL),(492,270,117,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(493,278,117,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(494,181,119,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(495,187,119,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(496,218,119,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(497,190,120,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(498,280,120,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(499,277,123,5,'Malik is already a seasoned activist and community organizer.

Every spring our students come together to each do a multimedia video story with a professional videographer. Prior to last year they were always incohesive separate narratives, but this time around Malik had the idea to weave them together into a comprehensive story about how students in DC are affected by the school-to-prison pipeline. He found a way to organize, coordinate and narrate the different student pieces into one short documentary that flows together smoothly to tell the everyday experiences our students encounter. \r\n',5,'Malik has shown great patience, self-determination and endurance just to get through his high school education. He tried going to three different high schools, trying to find one that met his needs for arts education and community support. None of the educational opportunities he was able to ask fulfilled the academic challenges necessary for his well being. He is now a senior who is homeschooling himself, and is finally feeling satisfied and like he will be able to reach his academic goals and is set to graduate on time. ',5,'I\'ve repeatedly seen Malik open new Critical Exposure students with open arms, eager to mentor them and facilitate their process of becoming activists and photographers. He\'s great at explaining what he\'s learned, which is a huge gift since he\'s truly a sponge for knowledge and is always reading another book or is working on learning a new skill. He\'s wonderful at facilitating political education workshops for other students and really enjoys the process of teaching others.

He\'s always immersed in trying to figure out how society ended up where it\'s at today, and how to work to effectively create positive change. When faced with a challenge within a campaign he\'s working on, I\'ve seen him really work to dig into materials and research, and then help other students understand what\'s really going on. ',5,'When the occasion calls for it, Malik doesn’t hesitate to reach out for help and communicate what he needs. For example, when we were moving into uncharted school-to-prison pipeline campaign territory, he was quick to suggest and seek out experts on school discipline policies around the county as well as locally to help find the data we needed to reach our goals. In my experience of working with him directly, he’s always quick to ask for clarification when he needs it, and is never afraid to speak up when he’s not understanding something I’m trying to teach. He’s also good at keeping a pulse on if everyone else in the room is following along and keeping up, and if they aren’t, he works to bring them up to speed and back into the conversation. ','Malik’s biggest challenge right now is overcoming financial barriers to accessing jobs and education, and how to navigate next steps therein as a non-heterosexual man of color. ','Even as a very mature 18 year old, it will still be an adjustment working 9-5 in a training program and entering the workforce full time. Supporting him through that transition will be invaluable.

Interns are uniquely situated, by the nature of their relatively short-term employment and relative inexperience, to either make dramatic, unexpected impacts or be nothing more than observant warm bodies. Both are useful experiences for the individual intern, but proactive interns obviously more greatly benefit the organization.\r\n\r\nAs an intern, Carmen made real, tangible impact on not only her office or Bureau, but on her entire agency through her lead on a holistic employee in-boarding/knowledge management system. This would be a significant accomplishment for any employee, let alone for an intern who had to also concurrently learn the systems and policies in place. This, as well as all the other contributions she made, led to her being the only Civic Fellow in our class of 30+ to be offered a fulltime position immediately following her internship. This speaks directly to her ability to contribute immediately in any team environment and her ability to efficiently, creatively and holistically process and address large-scale organizational problems.\r\n\r\nBy way of reference, the ILF\'s Civic Fellowship is a highly selective program that accepts less than 1/3 of its applicants, who are all highly accomplished Asian American college students. We have Fellows and applicants from Ivy league schools, top public universities and public and private institutions from across the country. ',5,'Carmen, despite being identified by ILF\'s leadership prior to the fellowship\'s start as an individual with especially great potential to contribute to the ILF\'s program and community, was initially met with a delay in her internship because of administrative complications with her Agency’s interim security clearance. Along with four other fellows, Carmen had to wait a week past her initial start date to even get into her office, after which she was delayed further in terms of gaining computer and project access. Rather than allowing herself to become frustrated by the fact that she was losing two substantial weeks out of the eight week fellowship, she maximized her unexpected situation by contributing directly to the ILF, taking the lead on updating and making more efficient the ILF’s alumni outreach processes, and orienting herself to the job she would have at USAID so that once she did receive access, she could hit the ground running. She quickly emerged as the group leader of the five ILF Civic Fellows who for various reasons had delayed internship start dates and her proactivity, positive attitude and leadership allowed the ILF’s thinly-stretched staff to accomplish much more than it had planned.',5,'4. Carmen was a leader in the ILF Civic Fellowship Program and has in her short time in D.C., assumed a leadership role in the Asian/Pacific Islander community as a whole by being selected to serve on the Board of Directors of the Conference on Asian Pacific American Leadership, arguably the central hub of APA non-profits and advocates in DC. \r\n\r\nThat Carmen emerged as a leader in the ILF is notable. By way of context, the ILF Civic Fellowship Program focuses on placing Fellows in federal internships. Additionally, ILF-specific weekly leadership trainings and socials are conducted. Despite these weekly meet-ups, the Civic Fellowship Program by design and necessity is relatively decentralized. However, our 2013 class was unusually close, in large part due to a culture of active participation facilitated in large part by Carmen and some of her peers. That she emerged as a leader in a group of young, accomplished individuals, selected specifically for their own demonstrated leadership, is indicative of Carmen’s great potential.',5,'I don\'t need to again rehash Carmen\'s great accomplishments at USAID in her short time there, but in short, Carmen\'s impatience with the imperfect status quo is what drives her to better herself so that she may better the system. This drive, which truly is exceptional and not something often seen even among her highly accomplished ILF peers, implies an extremely high level of productive curiosity and willingness to not only ask \"Why can\'t this be better?\", but to delve into the grind that change requires.',5,'Carmen is fiercely independent and has accomplished so much despite having had the deck stacked against her for most of her childhood. This independence has not in any way, however, interfered with Carmen’s understanding of collaboration and teamwork. During her ILF fellowship, Carmen never hesitated to appropriately and professionally question unclear directions or ideas with either her peers or the ILF staff – and she oftentimes did so on behalf of many other Fellows.','Carmen is a mature, driven and deliberate young woman who possesses a high level of self-awareness. She knows that her passions sometimes burn so hot that she runs the risk of personal burnout, yet, I believe, she constantly, and consciously, chooses to push her limits. \r\n\r\nThough I currently am in a part of the non-profit sector that does not deal in the sort of direct services that normally cause high levels of employee burnout, I come from a military background in which such concerns are paramount, but that are by operational necessity not usually addressed. Additionally, I serve as the Vice President of a non-profit Board that does have great concern for its employees’ potential for burnout given the intensity of their direct services work.\r\n\r\nFrom this perspective, I say that Carmen\'s great dedication to her work is by no means a dangerous or negative characteristic - and is truthfully one that any supervisor would appreciate. I simply am trying to make note of the fact that Carmen is a tremendously hard worker for whom future supervisors should prioritize self-care.\r\n','See number 7.',1,NULL),(516,180,155,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(517,185,155,5,'In my time advising Carmen in her role as a Break Leader I observed her many many times taking courageous stands with her peers, drawing their attention to racial injustice.

Haupu speaks up and lobbies on behalf of gender inequality (most recently, he offered testimony in favor of same-sex marriage in Hawai?i, which was successfully passed into law), speaks out issues affecting Kanaka Maoli (Hawaiians) related to the U.S. occupation of Hawai?i which include (but are not limited to) struggles for self-determination, militarization of the Islands, dispossession and homelessness, destruction of cultural and natural resources, desecration of Hawaiian burial sites, and genetically modified organisms (GMO)—all of which are linked to the occupation of Hawai?i and competing ideologies on the value of land. Haupu has also spoken out against problematic practices in academia within Hawaiian Studies at the University of Hawai?i at M?noa (an issue other students have spoken of privately but not publically for fear of reprisal). I would also like to highlight that Haupu is a sharp critical thinker and tireless researcher who understands that knowledge is power. He dedicates an impressive amount of time to doing research in different archives and shares his findings in social media, bringing these resources to the attention of other Hawaiians. This is an exciting era for scholars and students of Hawaiian knowledge as the discourse of sufficiency in the production of knowledge about Hawai?i that relies on a handful of problematic English-language translations to represent the whole of Kanaka Maoli intellectual production is increasingly challenged. As more people become aware of the different archives of Hawaiian knowledge there will be a huge shift in intellectual scholarship that promises to translate into political action aimed at social justice. As your website explains, Code for Progress offers training in “developing an innovation technological solution or online application to address organization or community needs,” which are exactly the kinds of skills a highly motivated leader like H??upu can put to good use in the Hawaiian community whether leading field projects or teaching organizational or creative problem solving skills to others. \r\n',5,'If successful problem solving requires critical thinking skills, focus, the ability to look at a problem from a different perspective, surmounting situational barriers, knowing when a change in approach is needed, embracing unconventionality, and also knowing when to ask for assistance then Haupu certainly possesses the characteristics necessary for creative problem solving. I have known H??upu for several years and I hold him in in high esteem. Our paths have crossed in both academic and activist settings. Code of Progress must necessarily perform a close reading of his curriculum vitae, his statement of purpose, and what his recommenders have to say about him to come to a decision regarding his candidacy. I would like to draw attention to the ways his curriculum vitae speaks to Haupu’s successful navigation of different careers—intellectual, corporate, artistic, and educational. He mastered the skill set needed to excel at each of these careers before continuing on in his journey to find his purpose in life. ',5,'Here, I refer back to what I have written in response to question 2. Haupu could not have succeeded at his various careers, which includes navigating personal and professional relationship with his colleagues, students, and his superiors without possessing patience and fortitude.I would also like to draw attention to the fact that Haupu also speaks several languages, and as someone who is fluent in three languages and conversational in a fourth, I can personally attest to the patience needed to acquire advanced linguistic fluency. This latter point speaks to learning code, which arguably, is a language.',5,'Haupu’s careers have included 1) teaching the theory and practice of hair design and aesthetics, the development of curriculum in this area; 2) working with Hawaiian students (many of whom are disadvantaged) in Native Hawaiian Student Services, and 3) assisting the Kokua a Puni program. In the last semester, as an Acting Assistant Professor of Religion at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I have seven taught Kokua a Puni students in one section, and I can attest to the value of the service persons like Haupu provide these students who overcome their learning disabilities to succeed in their academic journey. A few summers ago, I also taught a special section for students who rely on Native Hawaiian Student Services, so I understand the depth of teaching and mentoring that Haupu provided during his time there.  ',5,'Haupu is naturally inclined towards analyzing people and the structures of groups and organizations. He has often vocalized his critical and insightful assessment of political and academic structures. This penchant for understanding how people, groups, and structures work is one of his many strengths and identifies him as someone who has the potential to instigate social change on personal and community levels. In short, he has leadership potential.',5,'People ask for help for different reasons and in different kinds of situations. I chose two examples in this response: requesting help for personal reasons and for social causes. Haupu is an example of someone whom I believe is often able to surmount obstacles on his own because of the various qualities I have already mentioned in earlier responses; however, I have also witnessed his ability to seek assistance when needed, which suggests that he possesses a healthy degree of humility and trust in others, and an awareness of his limits. He definitely reaches out to the Hawaiian community to ask for assistance in struggles to right social injustices, putting out the call to Hawaiians to come forth in rallies. ','Honestly, I am hard pressed to think of a challenge that Haupu might face. ','I do know that creating opportunities for Haupu and his cohort to bond on different levels would be advantageous to all concerned as this would create solidarity that could translate into a life-long friendship and support group (at least that was my experience as a PhD student with my own cohort). Haupu certainly has a strong support network here in Hawai?i and he has often been a leader in that area (although he has also shown that he does not always need to lead and is excellent as being a supporter).',1,NULL),(551,314,282,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL),(557,328,288,5,'Harleen has been extremely committed to social justice issues throughout her time at Harvard. After participating in the First Year Urban Program (FUP), a social justice pre-orientation program for incoming freshmen, as an upperclassman she became a FUP leader, teaching freshmen about social justice issues and promoting community service and social change. Beyond this formal, programmatic work, Harleen’s commitment to social justice permeates her behavior every day. Last semester one of her professors stated in lecture that he didn’t identify as a feminist because wasn’t completely familiar with all of the literature on it. Frustrated with this professor’s cavalear disregard and ignorance regarding an extremely important issue, Harleen decided to take action and emailed him to explain that being a feminist “does not require years of consideration of Beauvoir or Butler”. She explained that although she had studied some feminist theory, what made her a proud feminist was simply the belief that men and woman are equal. Harleen continued, “It\'s important to normalize feminist beliefs as something that all can hold, not as something that takes year of struggle and study. This is especially important for you, as you speak twice a week to a group of students who may include applied math majors, Slavic studies majors, or computer science majors. To tell those students, from your position as a professor, that they cannot be feminists because they have not dedicated years to the field is not just incorrect, it is harmful.” Harleen’s courage to speak out for what she believes in and stand up for social justice issues, whether in the context of FUP, class, or dining hall conversations, is admirable. ',5,'Harleen serves as the chair of the selection committee for the Institute of Politics visiting Fellows program, who are various experienced professionals in political fields. Selecting the fellows is like a giant puzzle, as Harleen has to balance the interests of the students and staff, ensure there is enough partisan, thematic, racial, and gender diversity amongst the fellows, and ensure the fellows will work well with students and serve as passionate and charismatic mentors. This past semester, Harleen told me about one applicant who worked on personnel management at the White House. Although the applicant would be extremely valuable for students, her background did not exactly align with the mission of the Fellows program, so Harleen problem solved to create a special new position for her partnering with the IOP career office. This kind of creativity and problem solving is often necessary as chair of such an important committee. ',5,'Harleen is one of the most persistent people I know. When something appears difficult at first, this just motivates her further, and she perseveres until she is successful. For example, this semester Harleen decided to take the introductory computer science class, one of the most challenging classes at Harvard. For her final project, she created a computer program that used Facebook to help political campaigns connect target voters with campaign volunteers they know or have mutual friends with, as personal connection with the campaigner has been proven to significantly increase voter turnout. Harleen spent countless hours on this challenging project, despite her partner refusing to contribute and the relatively advanced nature of the code required. She ended up created an incredible website that will hopefully be utilized in upcoming campaigns. ',5,'Harleen has been an active mentor throughout college in many different capacities. Formally, Harleen teaches civics at an inner city school, mentors incoming freshmen as a leader of the First-Year Urban Program (FUP), and teaches high school students about politics and congress as a member of Harvard Model Congress, which runs several Model Congress workshops and conferences for high school students. She also was a Peer Advising Fellow, mentoring and advising freshmen on the transition to college, including everything from academics to extracurricular activities to social life. Harleen even started a mentorship program at the Institute of Politics and a number of younger students at the IOP formally and informally look to Harleen for advice. Harleen is one of those people who everyone looks to for help and advice, as she will immediately drop everything to assist a friend or a mentee. ',5,'Sophomore summer Harleen interned at the Obama campaign headquarters in Chicago. She was directly involved in coordinating his presidential campaign, and loved learning about the inner workings of the political system. She quickly realized that political campaigns were becoming increasingly data-driven and technological, and despite not having much background in the area, she wanted to know more about how it worked. At the same time, however, Harleen was fascinated not just by the processes in place, but also by how these systems and programs influenced real people and social structures. So, when she returned to school, she took classes on science and technology, changed her focus field to Democracy and Technology, and began writing a senior thesis on the theoretical implications of the increased utilization of technology in political campaigns. Harleen has investigated not only how political campaigns work, but she has delved into an entirely new field of technology and big data in order to further understand how the process of political campaigns works, why it has been set up the way it has, and what the consequences will be. ',5,'Last fall, a good friend of Harleen’s committed suicide. It was a really tough time for all of us, but Harleen was really shaken up by it. Instead of letting the grief build up, Harleen decided to speak with the resident dean and Mental Health Services. She was able to work through a difficult time and come out of it a better person, as she decided to channel the loss to be a better friend and spend more time with the people she loves. Harleen has made a conscious, tangible effort to prioritize people and relationships, which can be tough in the Harvard rat race. I am constantly amazed at how Harleen manages to seemingly do it all – maintain excellent grades, engage with a host of demanding extracurricular activities and internships, and constantly be an incredible friend. ','Harleen is extremely passionate about this topic and has been working diligently over the past few years to thoroughly understand the connection between democracy and technology. However, she didn’t recognize this interest until the summer after sophomore year, and therefore doesn’t have as much experience in coding and computer science. While I am fully confident that she can quickly learn these skills, as she has taken and thoroughly enjoyed several related introductory classes, she doesn’t have extensive experience with the subject.','Harleen is extremely motivated and passionate about the subject and definitely likes to be challenged.

Rather than getting discouraged and deterred, Empris kept working and searching until she found someone who runs an annual Wellness Summit that tackles issues similar to hers.

In the documentary they interviewed their fellow students at Loyola University and Tulane University and directed their questions to assess what young American college students might know about the conflict and the role of Palestinian and Israeli women in peace building. The documentary well served its purpose (the lack of knowledge in general, along with the importance of the role of women) and provided an interesting entrée to the debate. They complemented their film with an academic paper. In their research paper they documented the role of women in all proposed or implemented peace initiatives and most of the scholarly work and concluded that the role of this vital force has been overlooked.  Their bold and daring conclusion and innovative way of presenting the argument in his first semester at the University speak volumes about Christian’s potential.',5,'When Christian is doing something, you know that he is not doing it alone; as a good organizer he knows whom to contact for what.

I have seen her caring and support of other students who struggled to adapt to the Haverford world, in part because of their racial background. I believe she has a strong commitment to justice for all.',4,'Kylie was an outstanding Long and Triple Jumper. At many large meets the number competing in those events can exceed 60 women.

The level of confusion that was experienced went to zero. ',5,'Kylie competed as a national class athlete for me at Haverford College. On more than on occasion we competed in extremely bad weather. At times we had long delays in the middle of competition. In every instances Kylie calmly dealt with the setbacks or challenges. She always came prepared for inclement weather.

Kylie has long been interested in gender discrimination and has pursued that interest by taking a variety of courses related to gender politics within her major (political science) and minor (gender and sexuality studies). She also completed an outstanding senior thesis, which I supervised, on the obstacles faced by women running for election to Congress. Finally, Kylie has interned with Emily\'s List in Washington, DC, a highly-regarded public interest organization that provides financial and campaign support to women candidates running for state and federal office, and for the Women\'s Campaign International in Philadelphia, where she conducted research on the status of women in various countries around the world. In short, Kylie\'s commitment to social justice, and gender justice in particular, has been abundantly evident in her academic and career choices for many years.',5,'What springs to mind here is Kylie\'s ability to work independently and thus work out problems on her own. As noted above, I supervised Kylie\'s senior thesis on gender and electoral politics in the U.S. All seniors at Haverford College are required to complete a thesis and in the Political Science Department, this typically entails undertaking an extensive review of the scholarly literature on the student\'s topic, a research design that explains how the empirical research will be conducted, and then three months of collecting and analyzing data. The final thesis often ranges between 70-100 pages. Students vary considerably in their ability to carry out such an ambitious undertaking. Kylie is one of those remarkable students who was not only able to complete a truly excellent thesis, but was able to do so largely by relying on her own skills, creativity, and industriousness. Some students require a great deal of hand-holding to get through the thesis process. Not Kylie. She is unusually self-sufficient and capable. Someone who figures out how to resolve problems on her own and succeeds at a very high level.',5,'For this one, I\'ll go outside of my area as an academic. After she graduated from Haverford in 2012, Kylie decided to hike the entire length of the Appalachian Trail, by herself. It helps that she was a star of the track and cross country teams, but her success in completing that hike during the summer of 2012 is powerful evidence of someone who is extraordinarily capable of working through obstacles!',5,'I have no direct evidence of Kylie\'s ability here. I can only say that she was chosen by her peers to be the captain of the women\'s track and field team at Haverford, which suggests to me that Kylie is seen by her peers as someone who is adept at teaching and mentoring others. And that is consistent with my perception of her character and personality traits. Kylie is a genuinely nice person who cares about others. I imagine that she would be a natural as a teacher/mentor.',5,'I\'ll go back to Kylie\'s work on the senior thesis again. (I should add by way of explanation that the senior thesis is a big deal at Haverford. Each faculty member in the Political Science Department works closely with five, six, or seven senior majors during the course of an entire academic year in guiding each student through the process. As a result, we come to know our thesis advisees quite well). My pedagogical approach to thesis advising is to give each thesis advisee, and especially the more capable ones, considerable latitude in choosing a topic, mastering the relevant literature, formulating a research design, and conducting their empirical research. I tell my students that after taking courses for three years and listening to professors lecture or otherwise set the terms of a course, they now have the freedom to investigate thoroughly a topic that they deem to be fascinating, puzzling, exciting, etc. The best students, like Kylie, seize that opportunity to plunge into their research and satisfy their curiosity about \"how things work.\" Kylie wrote one of the very best senior theses of her class by exploring the multiple obstacles faced by women candidates running for Congress and developing strategies for minimizing or eradicating those obstacles.',5,'Notwithstanding Kylie\'s impressive independence in carrying out her thesis research (and this really is one of her finest attributes), Kylie was certainly willing to ask for my assistance. We met on average once per week for 20-30 minutes (in addition to class time during the fall semester) for an entire year to discuss her progress, so there was ample opportunity for the two of us to deliberate on what she was finding and how to proceed. She was also very good at hearing my advice and applying that advice.','The one challenge that I would like to see Kylie work on is that she sometimes seems rather quiet and a bit shy. That, in turn, may obscure her sharp intellect, strong commitment to important causes, and her impressive capacity to work very hard to achieve the goals that she sets for herself. But anyone who spends time with her (i.e. more than 10-15 minutes) will soon come to see and appreciate her many skills and talents.','Apart from encouraging her to be more outgoing and confident in her abilities, I would hope that you would be able to provide her with information about career opportunities in the political world. I honestly believe that whatever organization hires Kylie Lipinski will soon discover how fortunate it is. She is extremely smart, reliable, mature, diligent, and conscientious.',1,NULL),(616,401,58,5,'Clarise often goes above and beyond whatever it is that I\'ve asked her to do. She\'s always the first to volunteer whenever something needs to be done after hours, and I believe it\'s because she\'s so committed to the issue. For example, Clarise attended a full-day conference last week on Monday, and then still made sure to be home in time to monitor and engage in an 8:30 PM, hour-long twitter chat with Sec. Arne Duncan. ',4,'The I AM NOT A LOAN campaign is a pretty fast-moving campaign, which means that we often need quick turn-around. This is not always possible. We recently started an instagram campaign, asking folks to upload pictures using the hashtag #AccessMeans, and to let us know what access to education means to them. For this campaign, we needed a landing page, which was nearly impossible for the design team to create in the little time that we gave them. Clarise took initiative, and took an older landing page, changed the images, added a comment box, and spruced up the look slightly so that we could launch in time. ',5,'Clarise has labored over trying to figure out coding for pages at least 3 times since I\'ve worked with her on the I AM NOT A LOAN project. One example that comes to mind is the time that we needed to create a landing page for a campaign targeting UVA for cutting back on its financial aid promise for low-income students. She was literally on the phone with our service-providers for a day, and then trouble-shooting after following all of their advice. She eventually figured out herself how to make certain plug-ins work. As manager of this campaign, I would not have had the patience for that, and I was very impressed with Clarise and how she stuck with it.',5,'I know for a fact that Clarise mentors students from low-income families on the weekends, but she has often taken the time out of her day to teach others on staff how things are done. She never shies away from teaching another junior member of our team, Latasha, how to set up pages or look up metrics, and she always takes the time to explain to her why.  She\'s the first to edit blog posts and look over my copy. I trust her completely, and know that she\'s completely capable of taking over and spearheading projects in my absence.  ',5,'A few weeks ago, Clarise took initiative and decided we needed to know more about our constituents. She took on a project, and segmented our list based on who took action, how many times, what kind of emails they opened, and which emails they took action on. She also, very early on in the campaign, wanted to know what the best day was for us to send emails out on, and created a test to figure out how emails fared on specific days of the week. ',5,'Clarise will always put in her best effort to figure it out herself, and if she can\'t, she has never shied away from asking for help. She very recently couldn\'t figure out how to access something in Google Analytics, and then called me and asked me to walk her through it in the backend.  ','Clarise is very curious, and always asks \"why?\", which I think is excellent given the nature of the work that she and I do on the I AM NOT A LOAN project; however, I realize that it might be trying for others. Though I will add that her questions are always relevant and smart, and not pointless and annoying.','I think it\'s key to always making sure that you explain why what you\'re doing is important, and to be ready for her questions :)   ',1,NULL),(617,402,58,5,'In her work at the Education Trust, Clarise has challenged the organization to begin (and advance) work that has not traditionally lived in our wheelhouse.  For example, our work on closing gaps in opportunity and achievement for low-income and students of color in higher education has largely focused on three areas: affordability, student supports, and data/accountability.  Recently, Clarise discovered that students who have been convicted of possession or sale of controlled substances (while enrolled in school and receiving federal aid), can no longer receive federal financial aid to attend university/college. \r\n\r\nDespite knowing that the organization does not traditionally engage in matters related to aid eligibility, Clarise felt that in order for our organization to be true to our mission of ensuring equitable access to higher education, we cannot ignore this ban on student eligibility. \r\n\r\nShe has organized a project team, internally, to research the matter and provide recommendations on a course of action for the organization. This initiative and determination to provide equity of opportunity for all aspiring students is a wonderful example of her commitment to social justice, as the students most often affected by this ban are low-income, minority males. ',3,'Clarise is dedicated to solving problems she encounters and is willing to invest time in identifying solutions. She has, over the course of the last two years with our organization, become more creative in her problem solving. She is now the lead on organizing our field research, contacts and targeting information. Traditionally, this information has been stored in separate documents and even different types of documents.  Clarise, recognizing the annoyance and inefficiency of this, has been trying different types of solutions, and while we have not yet reached a conclusion on this work, she continues to experiment and find new/different ways we could approach organizing this information. ',4,'Our organization does not move on new issues, or on operational things, very quickly. For example, our editing process is lengthy, it may take us a full year to fully vet a policy position, these can seem like significant obstacles to individuals who work best in fast paced environments. Clarise has managed this challenge by developing greater patience, and more importantly, by by finding multiple avenues to keep working. For example, as the organization struggles to determine our position on a policy issue that Clarise needs for her college affordability campaign she finds projects currently under way, with other staff, in which to lend a hand (organizing state legislation, for example).  ',4,'Clarise has a keen interest in growing the knowledge base of others in our organization, she has taken lead on the development of a brown bag series to showcase the work of the Field team and highlight, for colleagues across the organization, the importance of relationship building, outreach, online advocacy, etc. She began this project after experience frustration with the silo\'ed nature in which our organization often times conducts its work. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her work within our organization to facilitate professional development, she also spends time mentoring middle school girls in the Higher Achievement program.  Clarise has grown quite extraordinarily in her role as a mentor to these young women, going from merely providing academic tutoring to field experiences around the city.  Clarise has been invaluable to helping these young ladies see a broader swath of the District of Columbia, and connecting that to how their academic trajectory can open doors for themselves in the future. ',4,'Clarise has most clearly demonstrated her curiosity for how things work in the online advocacy work she has spearheaded for our organization. At a time when we do not have a dedicated digital communications staff person on hand, Clarise has show great interest in figuring out why people (and organizations) engage in online advocacy and what the best online tools are. We launched a campaign last year, I Am Not A Loan, on college affordability.  Clarise has led that project team, she had to very quickly broadened her knowledge of our own CMS (Salsa)--and did so by attending webinars, the Salsa conference, and getting on the phone with the companies support team. Of note here, Clarise could have let the campaign role out as we have operated in the past, with limited engagement and use of our tools at hand, instead she felt very strongly that this campaign needed a more advanced set of tools that are available, and went forward to identify and learn those tools.  \r\n\r\nClarise has also taken the lead on identifying logical partners for the college affordability campaign.  The Education Trust does not have a broad network of higher education partners, Clarise has done extensive online research, information interviews, and reference checking to identify likely partners and then pitching the campaign to them.  Clarise has been successful in garnering us nearly a dozen partners for our campaign work, and continues to identify potentials. ',4,'Clarise is a wonderful advocate for herself.  During the course of the last year, her work load has increased quite a bit.  She has never hesitated to inquire about ways to get assistance on a project, not only has she never hesitated she comes with potential solutions.  For example, she writes a weekly internal communication regarding current happenings in the field, as the content grew and her other commitments grew she came to me (her supervisor) to inquire about ways to help maintain the quality of the communication while not dedicating the current amount of time to it.  She proposed solutions related to length, engaging other staff in the research & writing, and changing format. She and I discussed the relative merits of each of her suggestions and arrived at a compromise solution.  I can count on Clarise to ensure that the quality of her work is high, and sometimes that means she asks for help. ','Clarise struggles to appropriately prioritize her work, which leads to some time management challenges.  In my supervision of Clarise we are working to equip her with the right questions to ask of a manager that will help her establish the priority a project should have and the appropriate timeline in which it needs to be completed. ','Keep her busy, Clarise excels in fast paced work environments. Outside of that, frequent conversations with Clarise about her progress on her projects is helpful to gauging whether she is prioritizing correctly and managing her time well. Because Clarise likes to learn, she will often spend more time than is necessary finding solutions on her own, then ask for help.',1,NULL),(618,403,58,5,'Clarise is very dedicated to justice in each of the forms mentioned above.

Clarise is the kind of person who always wants to help out - either volunteering to solve a problem or coming up with an idea to help us find a solution.',5,'Clarise has a can-do attitude. On her last job, she had a boss who did not communicate her tasks clearly. Her boss gave little direction or feedback which left Clarise constantly frustrated and confused. Instead of complaining about the situation, she took steps to improve communication. She asked for more feedback and clarity. However, her boss was minimally responsive. Clarise did not give up. She came up with additional ways to increase communication with her supervisor, such as grouping questions into one email which ended up being effective. Eventually, communication increased to a level where Clarise was satisfied. It took time and diligence but she got there.',3,'I haven\'t seen Clarise in a mentoring position, but it strikes me as something she would be very good at.',5,'The way Clarise demonstrates this characteristic is her intellectual curiosity. Clarise is always reading. When troubled by injustice, she promptly researches to learn more about the issue. She is not satisfied by a surface-level understanding of an issue but has to dig deep into the history and analysis to examine the problem in depth before coming to a conclusion.',5,'In our Buddhist group, Clarise volunteered to manage communications. She\'s very good at it. But sometimes she gets stuck late at work or some other obstacle gets in the way; when this has happened, she\'s called me to ask for help. Clarise works collaboratively. She clearly communicates when she needs help getting the job done and she gives others sufficient notice so we can step in when she needs it. What\'s more, she wants to develop herself - she asks me how she can do things better. ','Clarise is a responsible, conscious person. She exerts leadership all the time by volunteering for the many tasks that arise in our Buddhist group (for example, being a study lecturer, discussion meeting facilitator, and communications leader). I worry that she takes on too much and have mentioned this to her. She always says, with a bright smile, that she wouldn\'t be volunteering for these things if she didn\'t have the bandwidth. Given that she generally follows through on her word, that\'s probably true. But I still worry that she\'s stretched too thin even if that doesn\'t affect job performance. ','Clarise once mentioned to me that at work she was struggling with keeping track of her many tasks. She said a colleague helped her design a to-do list \"tracker\" that helped organize her work.

All of these organizations are part of the immigrant rights movement and are dedicated to advancing the rights of immigrants--from various heritages and all walks of life--in the United States.',5,'Hareth does not see barriers -- she instead sees obstacles that she can overcome with creativity and persistence. She is an innovative young leader who has appeared on national television for her problem solving efforts. This includes appearances on CNN and Univision. In addition, she created Edu-Futuro\'s logo (www.edu-futuro.org) and helped the nonprofit design their website while she was in high school. More recently, she is seen as the \"creative force\" behind the Bridge Project, an organization working to connect individuals from across the political spectrum to achieve immigration reform that is sensible and workable for all. She is also the co-Founder of the Dream Project, a scholarship fund for youth aspiring to achieve the American Dream.',5,'Hareth is extremely patient and persistent. She will try and try again until she perseveres. That is how she has become a national leader in the immigrant rights movement -- she is not willing to give up her dreams. For example, in 2012 Hareth tried out for Edu-Futuro\'s annual talent show with a spoken word poem. She was not selected as a finalist. Undeterred, in 2013, Hareth tried out again for the talent show -- and this time the judges selected her as a finalist. Although she did not win a prize at the talent show, this poem eventually catapulted her into the national spotlight. You see, a few months later, she performed the poem again at the AFL-CIO 2013 convention and this was captured on video and posted to YouTube. As of now, the video of her performance at the AFL-CIO convention has gone viral and been viewed more than 150,000 times on YouTube.

During her high school years, Hareth participated in the Edu-Futuro\'s Emerging Leaders Program (ELP), a college prep and leadership development initiative. Through ELP Hareth received the support of mentors -- including myself -- who supported her in the college application process. Hareth is now paying it forward. As a community college student at Northern Virginia Community College, Hareth volunteered at ELP as a mentor, photographer, and videographer. She created beautiful promotional videos for the program that Edu-Futuro still uses on its website and social media channels. In this way, Hareth has made a lasting impact on Edu-Futuro\'s ability to secure funds and raise visibility for its valuable work with underserved youth in Northern Virginia.',5,'As mentioned, Hareth created Edu-Futuro\'s logo and helped build its website. In order to accomplish these tasks, Hareth had to learn how to use Adobe Dreamweaver and Wordpress without much support. Hareth\'s innate curiosity has propelled her to develop critical skills that have enabled her to secure highly competitive internships with large, national organizations such as the National Education Association and United We Dream.',5,'Part of the reason why Hareth has become such a successful young leader is because she is self-aware, reflective, and willing to grow. To this day, Hareth asks me for help and advice even though she graduated from high school in 2011. As her mentor, I am willing to help her and am always impressed by her willingness to ask for my support through the years. When she was preparing to deliver her poem at Edu-Futuro\'s talent show in 2013, she scheduled a meeting with me ahead of the show to gain tips on how to deliver the poem.

She has worked hard on advocacy campaigns about bullying in schools, the School to Prison Pipeline and access to arts in schools. Samera has become an activist with a camera and as a low-income, minority, female growing up in Washington, DC, I can confidently say that racial, gender and economic justice are three things that are incredibly important to Samera.',5,'Samera is incredibly artistic and creative. She works well at applying these traits to problem solving in different situations. Last May, our students had a big exhibit of their photo stories. After laying out the exhibit, we realized that we had one extra room in the gallery that we weren\'t sure what to do with. Samera was a strong leader in helping to plan an interactive game where the students acted as school officials reprimanding different students and the guests to the exhibit opening went through \'a typical day at school\' as DCPS students. Samera\'s ideas were at the core of the success of this project.',4,'This is an area where I would love to see Samera grow. She\'s stubborn and a very hard worker, so she sticks with projects until the end and makes sure that they turn out well. I\'d love to see her grow into a better collaborator. She\'s incredibly smart and sometimes wants to solve problems on her own because she knows that she can get it done, but doesn\'t always engage with other students in the program when these obstacles come up because she sees it as being easier to take on the issue by herself.

I would love to see her apply her interest in working with much younger youth to working collaboratively with her peers.

I have watched her learn complicated photo techniques in her own time and come into our offices to tell me about them. She\'s also a strong extrovert and enjoys meeting new people. I\'ve seen her present herself incredibly maturely at conferences and in other networking scenarios. ',4,'Samera has no trouble asking for help when it comes to building new skills in a classroom setting.

Samera also has a strong analysis of racial and economic inequality in D.C. and nationwide.',5,'Samera and her peers in the Fellowship Program were asked to create an interactive experience for visitors to Critical Exposure\'s 2013 Spring Exhibit of student photography & advocacy projects. Samera led the charge in developing an interactive simulation of the harsh disciplinary policies that D.C. students face when trying to get their education. Guests went through six stations of the school day -- metal detectors, being late to class, getting caught in the middle of a fight -- and faced a range of consequences that showed how school discipline policies disproportionately push-out low-income students of color. Over 200 people attended the event and Samera and her peers ran the simulation for over 2 hours. We continue to receive feedback about how amazing that experience was for our guests to truly wrap their minds around what students in D.C. go through. Also through our program, she has shot and edited two multimedia pieces that combine photos, video, and audio.',4,'Samera and her peers have been working to get DCPS to fund restorative justice programs for over a year. They have faced many obstacles along the way. One specific example was a Washington Post article written about the students\' campaign. The online version of the article garnered hundreds of comments, many of which were racist, classist, etc. Samera read these harsh comments but took them in stride -- she did not let it deflate her energy around the campaign. She is confident, resilient, and eager to move forward in every project she takes on.',3,'Samera is very confident and patient when teaching photography techniques to new students, which she has often done over the last 3 years. In overall interest of mentoring others, I think that this is a place where Samera has room to grow. At times she can become frustrated with the slower pace of collective decision-making, something that our group prizes. Because she is so sharp, she is often eager to make decisions and get on with a project. I have watched her improve in this regard over the last 3 years, and I am eager to see her continue to balance her own development with helping to develop the leadership of others.',4,'Samera has been an excellent researcher in our students\' campaign to stop the school-to-prison pipeline. She has an ability to comb through reports and pull out meaningful anecdotes and data, and she does a good job of synthesizing presentations or activities. She has also been strong in our Power Analysis sessions, where students talk about different decision-makers who might be relevant to their campaign. Just recently she observed that a member of the DCPS administration who currently oversees discipline policies might see that it is in his own interest to develop alternatives to suspensions.

The game was a huge success and supporters still regularly bring it up to us today.',4,'Samera is good at working through obstacles independently, she\'s very intelligent and self-motivated, but could use some improvement on working with others. She has a tendency to work through challenges very quickly, and can get frustrated when not everyone else in a group is on the same level, or working at the same speed as she is.

Several times over, I\'ve seen her eagerly dig into figuring out complex structures within DC Public Schools and local government. ',5,'Samera is good about reaching out and asking for help. Most recently, she has asked for help navigating building a resume, which we haven\'t had the time/capacity to help her with yet, but she\'s very good at communicating ways we can support her. She also really benefits from a lot of follow up and checking in. ','One of Samera\'s biggest challenges right now is financial difficulties. She\'s been working odd jobs, baby sitting and pet sitting, and has been frustrated and struggling to find something steadier before she eventually goes to college. I see it being very frustrating for her, and she\'s at a point where she wants to find some stability and start building her own independent life. \r\n\r\nIn response to her current life situation\'s instability, she\'s not been adjusting very well to changes to Critical Exposure\'s organizational structure as of late.

There turned out to be a terrible lack of information so much so that it\'s penalizing people who are unbanked by deeming them unsafe risks and giving them access only to subprime loans. She told me a lot of this could be alleviated if there was a website that addressed these issues from state to state.

After going round and round with them for hours he finally said \"we have $10,000 in the budget for the program, come back in 2 weeks and tell me what you want to do.\" They couldn\'t so he moved the money to the next arts and ed slated program and the same teachers and were able to do what they wanted although they had to delay their income for a couple of months. As patient and kind as he is, his wit and humor can eviscerate with the accuracy of a surgeons scalpel if he feels you are putting your self in front of the work or just being disingenuous. he had a phrase for well intened folks who indulged in unessesary obstruction: Social Justice Divas.\r\n',5,'I\'m an example for one. He challenged me as a researcher and observer to get out of my comfort zone and create community based programs out of the context of my work.

He was big on having fun and was fond of quoting writer bell hooks on the role of artists is to find the joy in struggle.',5,'I believe his favorite mantras were: \"Tell me why you think that is a good idea\" and OK so walk me through how this is going to work.\" But his favorite of course was  \"Declare your self interest.\" In other words, I know you\'re all down for the cause and the community but personally why are you doing this and what are YOU getting out of it. He\'d love to engage people to find out about their journeys and how they came to where they are now. He love to look at the group dynamics in the room and go from the micro to the macro and back on ideas. He is a firm believer in research, metics and measurable outcomes and would constantly push us in in staff and board meetings to go beyond the obvious: \"If budget were not a barrier, what would you do?\" And then \"Ok given the resources that we currently have, what can we do right now to get to that objective?\"\r\n',5,'Terry will always ask for help when needed, he asked me for help plenty of times. But I think that he\'s very strategic about who he asks for help, and that might lead the people to which he doesn\'t (or won\'t) turn to thinking that he\'s stubborn and unwilling to admit when he\'s stumped. I also think that Terry\'s \"ask\" doesn\'t always come across as a cry for help per se, but more like an invitation to collaborate. For us younger generations, that means everything; but for the older generations who are used to a certain amount of veneration before they can collaborate, it may not be received as sufficiently humble. His fundraising efforts were a good example where he often sought multiple points of view and assistance. He\'s definitely not afraid to to be seen as not knowing or understanding something and can be painfully unselfconscious (and funny) about his ignorance or ill preparedness.\r\n','He can be a bit short with people but always with a twinkle in his eye and a wry smile like the Grinch when he finds that he has a heart.

I met him while I was working with my organization and attempting to find college campuses that would work well with first generation college students – especially those who are willing to take the risk to leave home to break the cycle of poverty in their family.  Bobby Joe did whatever wanted, expected and knew he could do . . . and then it was simply too much.  But I learned about his story well before I ever met him and I was determined to get to know more about this young man.  Fortunately, I was able to meet him the year after he graduated.  And the perseverance and heart and soul of this young man were impeccable.  He went home, enrolled in the local university, worked and helped his mother continue to raise his three younger brothers and sister.  And he kept the door open to go back and get his degree at Middlebury College.  He came back the next autumn older, wiser, and calmer and determined to keep his head up high and complete what he had come to do – obtain a bachelor\'s degree.  And he did so with grace, joy and pride.  He graduated and left an incredible mark on that small college campus. You can still see him walk on campus and note that the faculty that taught him, the coaches who coached him and the younger students on campus still embrace the wide eyed caring and passionate man, we call Bobby Joe.',5,'And I can continue the story from above . . .. four years later after working in Washington D.C. at Cook Ross, Bobby Joe, still connected to several students and the organization that he founded, agreed to use his time and talent to help them fundraise to assist a school in Kenya build a library.  He used all of his vacation and sick time and spent five weeks in Kenya working with Middlebury juniors and seniors in a small village.  And what they found when they go there was not what they expected.  They thought they would roll up their sleeves and start building – but given the resources provided and the capacity of the townspeople, the library was underway.  What the community needed were faculty and mentors to assist with operational issues.  So Bobby Joe led the contingency of Middlebury students to shift gears and create curriculum, seminars and cultural activities to share and learn with the new school and local community.  And just like he had done at Middlebury, he included the entire community in the planning and implementation.  To this day, he says he learned more than he could have ever possibly given.  He was able to help everyone get to a place where they could question themselves, their choices, and their beliefs.  He again found a way to empower all.',5,'Bobby Joe has a keen interest in almost everything he touches.  He cares deeply about being in the moment and recognizing the importance of the \"now\".  Don\'t get me wrong, he has BIG ideas and a BIG heart and can often get swept away in trying to make those really big things happen all at once.  But his appreciation for philosophy and politics keep him wondering how people work, how systems work and how we can get people to trust, understand and hold with great care the spirit and soul of each person.  This lead him to taking a job at Cook Ross for the past four years – he wanted to intimately understand how people and organizations work and wanted to fully grasp what worked for people and how to get people to learn how to work together.  He thought Cook Ross would be ideal – a small for-profit company that was committed to social justice and diversity throughout global corporations.  While he learned a great deal – he recently decided he was ready to move away from the desk and the research and the spreadsheets and actually \"do\" the work \"with, for and by\" the people.',4,'Bobby Joe came from an environment in which he was the recipient for much “assistance” – whether it was food, clothes, affection, school, books, sports, or a college education – he felt lucky, blessed and worked hard.  And perhaps (in my humble opinion), like many of us, he did not think he should or was supposed to ask for anything else.  Even as he was leaving Middlebury, he struggled to be as responsible as possible – for himself and his family. Slowly and surely he is learning that we ALL need someone a lot of the times and that really successful people have learned how to ask for help and ask for advice as needed.  He is becoming much more comfortable with starting those conversations.  It may take him a bit more time to internalize truly how to utilize this \"networking\" and professional experience, but he now has the confidence and the ability to do it, and is quite driven.  ','Bobby Joe is a deep thinker.  He wants to be the best (in the most humble way) and wants to capture it all just right.  Many of us know that such a notion is a life journey.  But Bobby Joe lives most of his day in that frame of mind. So it is key that he has a team around him to keep him grounded. He does well with direction (very self-motivated and attentive to detail) and loves to be part of a team (does not have to be the loud or quiet leader).  But he will always be thinking about how to make it better, deeper, beautiful, and more meaningful.  He loves to continually allow all of his senses to be working . . .. and thus will need a few teammates who don\'t mind creating the map and keeping people on point to complete the desired task at hand.\r\nBobby Joe is also the “shining star” in and for his family.  He is the eldest of four from a single mother.  He is ten years older than his next sibling in age.  He is constantly pulled back into the physical, emotional and financial caretaking of his younger siblings, with a mom who live in Minnesota and his aging maternal grandparents who helped raise him who live in North Dakota, outside of the Reservation.  He often Skyped and called to help his mother work through the challenges of raising his siblings.  And later he added the responsibility of providing the “extra” help he could with material and financial comfort. \r\n','Bobby Joe LOVES working with and for people.  He thrives when he is surrounded by people – never taking over a crowd or dismissing someone in the crowd.  A network of people who have his similar values and understanding is what he is craving.\r\nHe needs a structured place and space to create.  He needs some clarity and mentorship of similar age colleagues and also elders who can have the deep level and long conversation as well as have the time to laugh and be silly.  He is respectful and open, and will lean much in that environment.\r\nHe needs check points and check-ins so that he can develop a way of creating and producing that can allow him to sustain himself and family. \r\nHe needs to know that it is okay to find himself, let others help and release himself from the incredible guilt and burden of taking care of a nuclear family that he did not create.  He needs to know how to help without being overburdened.\r\nHe needs and cherishes thought partners who challenge, stretch, encourage and guide.  He is smart, fun, beautiful – inside and out and truly deserves to have this incredible opportunity.  While he has had many opportunities come his way, he is becoming the man he wants to be and is finding a medium (photography, videography, writing and hopefully coding to solve the distribution question) to share himself and others with the world.

It’s always hard to admit your shortcomings and when you’re in the midst of job hunting, you have to face what those might be. He’s always open for new ideas and new suggestions. What I appreciate is that he actually takes suggestions to heart and follows through.','Matt is incredibly smart and has a kind heart. Sometimes, I think his brain moves to fast for his month and he misses some social cues that can result in either missed opportunities for him or others shutting him out. Matt knows his stuff and with some tailored education could become a big player for others that may not have a voice. But because of his jitters and (to simplify it) awkwardness that can appear in social situations, he’s going to have an even harder time finding himself in that role.','As I mentioned in the previous question, I think people are quick to judge Matt, writing him off as incompetent or unable to do a task because of his jitters.

There are days when I do not know what I would do without his help.',4,'I did not personally observe this myself – am only aware of it through Matt’s sharing of the story.  Matt was used to having his own room and bath from the time he was in junior high to the time he went off to college. Since his older brother was six years older than he, it was very much like being an only child.  When he got to college, he was suddenly put in a dorm room, quite small compared to his bedroom and the rest of his living space at home, and a bathroom down the hall, and sharing the room with another person or in future years, more than one.  Being quiet and somewhat shy at that time, it was quite an adjustment.  His first roommate was quite outgoing from what I observed.  Matt managed to negotiate the hows and wheres of sharing the space and spending the time and who was suppyling what for the room, without major trauma, without either moving out and with still being able to greet one another to this day should they meet on the street.\r\n\r\nThe other obstacle it helped him overcome was speaking with people, saying his  piece, getting himself included in groups, getting comfortable joining in and making suggestions.

I would say a successful working through of obstacles!\r\n',5,'Matthew is very well-versed in the hardware and software of iPhones (almost all recent versions), iPads, various Macs and even some PC’s.  He is, without question, the person I go to when I have technical questions in any of these areas.  He helps me learn what I need to know.  He teaches me what I MUST know.  New phones, new applications, new operating systems – he walks me through them all and keeps patiently answering questions until I’ve run out.  He not only answers mine, but he often answers calls from my friends, from my personal trainer – anyone I know who has a problem!  I haven’t often seen him working with his friends, but I have heard small snatches of phone conversation that lead me to believe he’s doing the same with them.  That’s the kind of guy he is.  Help those in need.',5,'Matthew’s curiosity about how things worked showed itself at a very young age. Matt and I always spent a lot of time in the car together driving him to school while I was on my way to work.  Treasured time because he had a very precocious, verbal older brother who liked to be center stage.  Our time alone gave Matt a chance to explore questions he’d been storing up – one I remember vividly as we were on our way to first grade.  It was an election year and lots of talk filled the airwaves about what “I’ll do if I’m elected….”   He asked, “Mom, how do laws get made?  And so our ride was taken up that morning with my best job at explaining to another fairly precocious young man how people come up with the need for a certain law, get together, put it down on paper, discuss it, shepherd it through the process, explain to the best of my ability what the process is, etc., etc.  I must say, for someone his age, he asked really tough questions.  It was one time I wish his dad had driven him to school!',4,'College, as Matt found, was much different than high school.  One needed to be much more independent in understanding what the teachers wanted done and in accomplishing the assignments.  Early on in his life I started encouraging Matt to ask (whomever) whenever he didn’t understand what was required.  I’m proud to say that he was never unwilling to do so.  There may have been times when he was afraid or nervous, but never unwilling.  I’m not sure that Matt knows the old saying “there’s no such thing as dumb questions, only dumb answers.” but he lives by it!','I think each person learns best in a different style.  Matthew is a very bright person and also happens, as is often the case with bright people, to have ADD.  As a result he learns best by listening.  He can, and does, read a lot, but it takes him longer to read and absorb than some other people.  Because his ADD is MN state certified he is allowed extra time in classes to take tests, and to complete assignments.  While your class work may not be time sensitive, it\'s good to be aware of his situation.  It has never kept him from accomplishing something that he has wanted to do.','You can be aware of his learning style and support it.  Re-explain concepts or take extra time to answer questions.

',1,NULL),(677,477,366,5,'I am the Program Director at Social Justice Fund NW, a foundation which supports community organizing throughout the Northwest. I’ve been lucky enough to work with Magan as she has played three different roles in our organization: \r\n•	As a staff member while she did her practicum with us in 2011-12 (which included participating in the first Criminal Justice Giving Project); \r\n•	As a volunteer while she participated in another Criminal Justice Giving Project in 2012; and\r\n•	As a board member beginning in 2013. \r\n\r\nI was Magan’s supervisor during her practicum, the lead facilitator of both Giving Projects that she participated in, and have worked closely with her in her board service.\r\n\r\nFor context, I’d like to explain Social Justice Fund’s model. All our grantmaking is done through Giving Projects. Each Giving Project is a multiracial, cross-class group of 15 to 25 volunteers who each make a commitment of about six months. During that time, the Giving Project members:  \r\n•	Build community together\r\n•	Develop a shared foundational analysis of race and class, learn about community organizing as an approach to social change, \r\n•	Raise money from their own personal networks to fund the grants they will make, Read and score grant proposals from dozens of organizations, \r\n•	Decide as a group which organizations will receive site visits, \r\n•	Conduct the site visits, and finally, \r\n•	Choose through a consensus-based process which organizations will receive the grants. \r\n\r\nIt is an intensive (generally over 100 volunteer hours per Giving Project) but rewarding process, which we believe serves a dual purpose of accountable grantmaking for social justice, and organizing donors into a more connected and powerful social justice movement. \r\n\r\nWhen Magan did her practicum with us, she joined a staff of just five, still in the early stages of developing the Giving Project model. Although our organization was well-established, the model was new; we were essentially in startup mode and every team member’s contributions made a huge impact in the outcome. One of the biggest accomplishments that year was the development of a new race and class workshop, which became the cornerstone of every Giving Project curriculum. Magan helped develop, test, evaluate, and improve that curriculum. Her hard questions and honest feedback (both based in a solid analysis of racism and classism at the individual, institutional, and structural level) were invaluable in that process. \r\n\r\nSocial justice principles guide our grantmaking process. These include funding only organizations which are led by those most directly impacted by the issues the organization is working on, addressing root causes with systemic change rather than focusing on symptoms, and prioritizing racial justice and long-term movement building. We train all Giving Project members on our grantmaking process and underlying principles, but when the time comes to make funding decisions, the discussion is often emotional and difficult for the participants (and challenging for the facilitators). Magan has been a steady compass in those discussions, continually bringing the group back to the social justice principles. \r\n',5,'When Magan started her practicum with us, I intended to treat her like any other staff member, with valuable input on a variety of high level organizational and programming questions. I have since decided that Magan might have set an unrealistically high bar. \r\n\r\nAt that time, we had just completed our first round of Giving Projects. We were in the process of evaluating everything, making a ton of changes ranging from technical to fundamental, launching new Giving Projects, and adding new staff and board members. We were also under a great deal of pressure to raise more money than ever and prove that the new model wasn’t just a one-year fluke. It was a chaotic time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Magan was our first practicum student, so her role was not yet defined. In the midst of all this chaos, we had to figure out together what exactly she should be doing and how she could most strategically add to our capacity while achieving her own learning objectives. Many people would have been frustrated by this situation. Magan simply adapted. She was flexible, responsive, and creative.  \r\n\r\nOne of our biggest challenges was in adapting our curriculum based on the lessons learned in our first round of Giving Projects. Our curriculum needs to serve several competing and occasionally contradictory objectives, which cover analysis, skills, relationships, and organizational goals. Magan was instrumental in helping us think through and try different solutions to those issues, particularly in becoming more accessible to different learning styles and personality types. \r\n\r\nWe were also scaling up at that time, adding new Giving Projects and therefore a lot more prospective members. Magan helped devise and implement systems for tracking outreach efforts and intake of new volunteers. ',5,'Magan’s patience flows from a balance of idealism and pragmatism – a necessary balance for any effective social change leader. I think I have seen it most clearly in how she interacts with other Giving Project members and board members, particularly during difficult group discussions. She is an excellent listener, and plays a valuable role by synthesizing what she hears from the group and reflecting it back in a way that  brings clarity and direction to the group. She’s never afraid of stating her own opinion and advocating for her position, but she does so respectfully and professionally. ',5,'As a staff member, volunteer, and board member, Magan has excelled in one-on-one outreach, bringing new people into our Giving Projects. What is particularly notable, however, is the quality of her recruitment. Every single person she’s brought in has been an exemplary Giving Project member, fulfilling all of their commitments to the process. We have about 80% retention overall, but Magan’s recruits are 100%. Several of them have stepped up as leaders in their own right – setting fundraising records, chairing our Member Engagement Committee, and recruiting other stellar new members. I chalk it up to Magan’s commitment to her relationship to these people and their personal growth, as well as her commitment to the organization and its development. \r\n\r\nIn outreach conversations, she balances enthusiasm with candor, so that her recruits start out excited but well-prepared for the commitment. As they go through the Giving Project process, she checks in with support and encouragement as needed. In last year’s Criminal Justice Giving Project, she played a key role in organizing the group to spend time together outside the meetings. Although this time was social on the surface, she used it to build relationships with her fellow Giving Project members so that she could better support them. That Giving Project felt like the most bonded group we’ve had so far – despite huge differences of experience in class, race, gender identity, profession, and political background. It also set new records in fundraising and grantmaking. I am sure that Magan’s leadership was a big part of that success. \r\n',5,'As described above, the “start up” organizational culture that Magan walked into was challenging and chaotic. We often joked that we were building the engine while the car was hurtling down the freeway. Magan could survive in that environment because of her adaptability and unflappable personality. But she could thrive in it because of her curiosity; she enjoyed thinking about how to put the engine together. \r\n\r\nNot only did she jump into this situation and hit the ground running, but she did so in a way that helped the whole team – by asking smart, insightful questions about why we were doing what we were doing. This affected the way we improved the curriculum and our outreach and intake systems. \r\n\r\nAs she has continued as a Giving Project member and board member, I have noticed that she is one of those people who speaks very little unless she actually has something to say. Often her contributions are helpful observations about what is happening in the group dynamic, stemming from curiosity about what makes these group processes work. In site visits and grantmaking discussions, she displays curiosity about what makes organizations effective – including smart questions about infrastructure, leadership development, and financial sustainability – but is always able to ask those questions in a respectful way that moves the conversation forward and translates to better decisionmaking. \r\n',5,'Magan continually chooses tasks and projects that push her to the next level. \r\n\r\nShe chose to do a second Giving Project because she wanted to challenge herself to do more and better fundraising, and asked staff and other Giving Project members to support her in doing that. She became a board member because she wanted to deepen her commitment and contribution to our own organization, and wanted to challenge herself to step up her leadership. When she joined our board, she asked an older board member with an accomplished background in social justice philanthropy to mentor her in board service. When she decided that she wanted to gain more experience in facilitation, she asked me for those opportunities. (I have responded by having her facilitate pieces of our workshops and pairing her with another board member to facilitate a workshop on community organizing for another organization.) Recently she decided to \r\n\r\nMagan does not take on commitments lightly. In my experience with her, she has gone into every commitment with clarity about what she is signing up for, what she has to offer, and what she stands to gain. She asks for help to make sure she is being as effective as she can be, and then she puts that help to good use. \r\n','In my experience with Magan, I can’t think of much. She tends to meet any challenges with a down-to-earth nature. I do think she has a hard time selling herself and this has held her back. I’d like to see her become more confident and comfortable in talking about her strengths and accomplishments. \r\n','I honestly cannot think of anything. From what I\'ve read of this program, I think it sounds like a wonderful fit and a great next step for Magan, and I have no doubt that she will excel in the program and be a more effective change agent afterwards.

Magan actively interrogated the AmeriCorps program and explored the ways in which non-profit organizations often reinscribe the very injustices they are seeking to eradicate.',5,'Another side to Magan is that she is a talented cook and baker.

She remained patient and calm, asking her supervisor to meet to discuss the problems she was having. They had several meetings over a period of a couple months. There was not an overnight solution but the supervisor responded very positively because Magan addressed the situation directly while remaining patient so they could work through the process together. ',5,'Magan was a classroom and after-school tutor for high school students with the Urban League Scholars program at Garfield High School. She met with students enrolled in the program to help them with academic work, as well as coach them through the college application process. She enjoyed the challenges and rewards of mentoring these students. She led by example, behaving in a professional manner while simultaneously building meaningful relationships. She also mentored the adult volunteers who came to help with the after-school program, integrating them into the community and often staying after hours to discuss any issues or simply debrief.',5,'Magan is a very analytical person. When she started working with Social Justice Fund NW she was an intern completing her MSW at the University of Washington. She had one specific role that was very behind-the-scenes. After she finished her internship she stayed involved with Social Justice Fund and transitioned into a Giving Project Member. She wanted to see how the programming worked and became a participant. After completing her first successful Giving Project she actively recruited others to join the Giving Project in the following year. She then joined the Board to have an even greater impact and influence the way the organization is run. Magan has been able to bring the perspective of a college intern, volunteer, program participant, and Board Member to meetings. She continued her involvement with the organization but changed roles to get a greater sense of what the organization does. ',5,'When I was the Team Leader for our AmeriCorps team, Magan asked me to meet with her several times to problem-solve issues she was having at her service site. She also reached out to another co-worker to ask for help in managing her workload. Magan is direct and articulate and able to ask for what she needs.

I believe after the initial culture shock she will flourish in the program. Any support you can provide to ease the transition would be helpful.','I think Magan is interested in this program as a way to learn new hard skills that she can bring back to her community and the non-profits she has been involved with.

In my work with him, I\'ve learned about his background and his family, his close relationship to his sister who faced deportation proceedings several years ago, how he wanted to go to college after graduating high school but couldn\'t afford the tuition, how he decided to make it his mission to fight for his family and his community.  He\'s very empathetic and cares not only about his own struggle for justice, but also the shared struggles other people and communities face.  The best example I can think of is his tireless dedication to his work for immigrant rights-- at high-peak moments in United We Dream\'s work, Jassiel has worked long days and worn many different hats, always willing to say \"yes\" and pitch in to help advance the organization\'s mission.  He\'s a talented photographer, graphic designer, writer, and online organizer who built his skills to serve the movement.',4,'Jassiel graduated from high school and knew that college was out of reach financially, given that in Florida, undocumented students are charged out-of-state tuition, even if they\'ve lived in Florida for years and graduated from a Florida high school.  Instead of letting that stop him from pursuing his dreams, he spent hours and hours watching video tutorials, reading books and sites, and teaching himself graphic and web design.  Hearing him tell the story, and seeing the pride in his face when he describes the very first website he built, is inspiring.  He overcame a significant obstacle and built his skills to develop his own career and give back to the community that has supported him and his family (his first projects were for central Florida immigrant rights organizations in his own backyard).  He\'s always seeking opportunities for growth and professional development and looking to build his skill set and I\'ve found him refreshingly open to feedback.  In a smaller scale context, I\'ve seen him manage organizational ambiguity and challenges well (i.e. waiting to hear from field organizers about plans for an action, learning that the functionality we\'d been planning on for a petition won\'t work, etc.) and problem-solve to propose online campaigns that don\'t rely on specific field organizing details or find a technical workaround.  We tried multiple story-collection campaigns and kept running into road-blocks, either in terms of participation or in terms of technical wherewithal.  He was always coming up with new ideas, building new landing pages, promoting new iterations of the campaign with graphics and photos on social media, thinking through what worked well and what didn\'t. ',5,'I\'ve found Jassiel extraordinarily patient and constantly good-humored about challenging situations and obstacles.  He takes things in stride and always assumes the best of people and is a joy to work with.  He sees obstacles as challenges and thrives with that challenge, finding ways forward and keeping everyone\'s spirits up.  During a December push to target Speaker Boehner on immigration, our organizing team asked for a member of the communications/online team (which I led and which Jassiel was part of ) to arrive early to Ohio to support a planned action at Boehner\'s church on Sunday, four days before the main action.  Jassiel was gracious enough to agree to go to Ohio earlier than planned, giving up a weekend and having to leave RootsCamp early.  Then the organizing team changed the plan and didn\'t end up doing the action at the church.  I know he was frustrated but he took it in stride and figured out what else was happening that weekend and how to support it, as well as working with me and the organizing team to try to avoid a similar situation arising in the future.',4,'In my work with Jassiel, I\'ve seen more of him learning and being mentored than doing the teaching and mentoring and found him such a joy to work with because he\'s so open to growth and improving his skills.  I have also seen him teaching, explaining, coaching, and supporting others and have also always been really impressed with him in this context.  He\'s led online, social media, and graphic design trainings for UWD affiliates and done an excellent job breaking down complicated ideas, responding to questions, and presenting information in a compelling and clear way.  ',5,'I know Jassiel likes to tinker with things online and he\'s always excited about new tools.  When I first starting working with him, we were revamping the United We Dream website and his eyes lit up describing various ideas he had for different pages and functionality we could integrate into the redesign.  I see this curiosity in him a bit more on the online/digital side than on the personal side; he\'s quite reserved and while very amiable, doesn\'t often open up about his personal life or ask a lot of personal questions of his colleagues (i.e. figuring out what \"makes them tick\").  But he is a very empathetic person and I think is tuned into to how different people work, react to information or challenges, etc. and does everything in his power to optimize his work and his relationships.',5,'Of all the people I\'ve managed, across multiple organizations, Jassiel is by far the most excited about mentorship and the most open to feedback.  He really sees supervision as a source of support and was always excited for our 1-to-1 check-ins and employee evaluations.  He is willing to ask for help and to let his colleagues or supervisor know when he\'s not sure how to proceed or wants to think through a problem together.  He does have a bit of a tendency to say \"yes\" to too much and then end up with an unmanageable workload, so sometimes I would have to check in and play traffic cop with requests coming in from staff and affiliate leaders, but I definitely saw him improve at setting boundaries, managing priorities, and asking for help and direction.','United We Dream has asked a lot of Jassiel over the 2 years or so that he\'s been with the organization and I think it\'ll be hard for him to set his commitments to UWD aside for the period of time that he\'s part of Code for Progress.  I think he\'ll feel torn about his excitement at the opportunity and his fervent desire to grow professionally and his sense of responsibility to an organization that is not just his employer but his family and community.  That being said, I think he would be such a wise choice for Code for Progress-- he\'s incredibly smart and curious, he has a passion for social justice and immigrant rights in particular, he\'s so open to growth and feedback, and I think this investment would pay dividends for him personally and for the organizations and movements he\'ll serve in the future.

In her music-making, she leads a collective of lady DJs. In her organizing, she works to protect and support the long-time residents of her Columbia Heights neighborhood. As a queer, Black, immigrant woman, these are not just abstract issues for Selina. She fights for racial, economic and gender justice because she holds a deep love for marginalized voices and has tremendous respect for their contributions, and she fights for those causes as a matter of survival. ',5,'This is a little bit of a left-field example, but the question makes me think of a time that we were in Detroit at a conference together. A friend\'s wallet was stolen, with her ID in it, the night before she was supposed to get on a plane. Selina helped her friend retrace her steps, and when the wallet didn\'t appear, calmly identified the options with the airline, helped get the requisite paperwork from the police station in the middle of the night, and everyone flew home on time. I\'ve also seen her problem-solve logistical hurdles in public schools, night clubs, and workshop sessions.

Selina navigated these challenges with grace, patience, and perseverance, earning the respect of the DCPS teachers and the love of her students. ',5,'As I say above, she taught classes in DCPS for several years, and did so with great skill.

She is tremendously intuitive and sympathetic listener, curious about people and their needs and goals. She is particularly interested in questions of organizational structure as they relate to making groups more accessible to women, queer people, people of color and low-income people.',5,'When she was teaching for People\'s Production House, she would track the problems she encountered with her students and bring them to me and my co-director for support and mentoring.

Decisions were made in big monthly meetings Selina played an incredibly important role in this process, making sure everyone was heard and valued but also that key things got taken care of - the trash got taken out, the equipment was fixed, people showed up for their shows. Selina is an excellent facilitator in these kind of group processes. ',5,'In all of our projects, being able to ask for and offer help has been incredibly important. Selina asks for help but not to be rescued.

She rolled up her sleeves, made a plan and asked for help in getting the word out about the event in the days leading up to it through an intensive social media push, phone calls and emails.

Rommy continues their involvement with the immigrant youth movement state-wide as a leader in the Florida Immigrant Youth Network (FLYN)and locally with the Collier County Neighborhood Story Project (CCNSP) which fights deportations and documents abuses.

As an undocumented student he knew that he was not the same as many of his peers. He knew he had to work harder in order to succeed.

Since then he has given his energy and passion to empower others, to give them the hope that at one point he thought he had lost. Through his work he has developed many youth into leaders in their communities and he has empowered undocumented youth to come out as undocumented and unafraid. ',5,'Conrado is one of the most creative problem solvers I\'ve met. Having worked together for two and a half years has given me the opportunity to see this first hand. The organization we worked in is made up of four paid staff and because of it our roles could differ at many points. Conrado was always the one who had the most diverse roles because of his way of approaching challenges and willingness to take on bigger ones. At one point, one of our biggest challenges was that we didn\'t have a strong structure or capacity to support 12 field teams. He went on to create a structure with a team of leaders to not only support these teams but to also develop these leaders into organizers and mentors. ',5,'Last year we were working on stopping the deportation of a worker in Massachusetts. We only had a couple of days to get community support through petitions and calls. Conrado took on the creation of the petition through Salsa Labs. After working on it for an hour or so we realized that the petition did not look right. The formatting was all messed up. Through calls with colleagues who used Salsa Labs, googling and trial and error it took him about four hours to figure out what was happening. The petition went live and not once did I hear him say \"I can\'t do this\" or \"lets forget about this.\" ',5,'Every time I think what would Conrado be doing in 5, 10, 15 years I see him teaching. For many years one of his dreams has been to open up a community center for youth where they can be taught leadership skills. Through innovative teaching methods he wants to mentor youth to be more engaged and become decision makers in their community.',5,'Most of his work at SIM was about figuring out what worked best for our constituency. Before our annual new membership training (SIM Camp), we went through a process of figuring out what motivated youth to join SIM and what we needed to provide them to develop new leaders. Conrado led the team in the creation of a curriculum specific to those needs. Thanks to his curiosity and passion we were able to have one of the most successful trainings.',4,'Even though he prefers to solve problems by himself, we were always able to work together as a team. Over the time he has learned to value the importance of asking for help. I remember one of his challenges at first was management of his time.

We worked in creating a shared work-plan with our core team so that we could keep track of our weekly goals and overall goals. ','Conrado has been out of school for a while.

',5,'Conrado spent a long time working on an internal restructure and planning process for SIM to figure out how to align our very limited staffing and financial resources with all of the work that needs to be done for our members and communities. He came up with many innovations around position descriptions and scope of work that stepped away from traditional staffing models and spread the work out to engage more people. ',5,'There was a time at SIM where there was a small group of leaders that was ideologically opposed to the campaign we were working on and what the majority of the membership wanted to do. Conrado figured out a way to achieve a delicate balance for those leaders to have a voice while also supporting the work that other members were immersed in and proud of. He accomplished this primarily by empowering those that had objections to see themselves as leaders and take ownership over a new strain of work. He was extremely patient and graceful throughout this time. ',5,'Conrado\'s main interest in being an organizer was precisely to help others find their voice in the same way he did - this is his primary and leading motivation for everything he does. He is able to see and help light the spark in others. Many of SIM\'s current staff and leadership are people who he saw that spark in and invested hours over coffee, visits, and trainings to help them see it in themselves. ',5,'See answer for #2. I\'ve never seen anyone so excited to really unpack the way we do things and work on something like organizational structure with such zeal. Also as an organizer he has spent many hours trying to figure people out, agitating them without them feeling agitated, and really just sitting with people in their own struggle. ',5,'Conrado is very smart about using the resources around him and he often taps others who have more experience or experience in the specific area he\'s struggling with to help him along.

Being Hispanic/Mexican-American gives so many great opportunities to people since they have been exposed two or more worlds.

Jose is considerate in taking everyone’s opinion and making the best of it. He creates ideas, involves people’s creativity to become curios and make something happened.',4,'6.	What I see in Jose to be willing to ask for support and help is his security of becoming a learner. By this I mean that he is attentive and communicative on his needs. Jose wants to do thing right! He know when and how to be right, meaning that he wants to ask for an assertive answer to make effective his progress if he feels there is something unusual or not right. ','A challenge for Jose would be that he is a very reserved person. I do not see this as something negative, but it takes him a bit to open up.

Having experience difficulty obtaining a college education, identifying with the struggles of being a second generation Mexican-American immigrant, and being a male of color, Jose definitely knows the issues faced by youth like him. Time and time again, I have heard him express his deep passion for making a difference for young men who have felt lost and discouraged by the tough circumstances they face because information and advancement opportunities are not widely distributed to youth and their families. It is because of this precise reason that he’s demonstrated interest in using coding to create an application or website that will allow young people and their families, especially those who are part of the immigrant community, to easily access information about obtaining an education, opening a business, and several other opportunities that would help our communities to keep on thriving. \r\n',5,'One of the things that has impressed me the most about Jose is that he has a superb ability to victoriously overcome any challenges and difficult situations presented to him. I believe his determination and flexible character have allowed him solve problems in unexpected, yet wonderful ways. One of the many situations that exemplify Jose’s incredible innovation in problem solving is when he decided to start designing and making his own pairs of custom-made jeans after futile attempts of finding a pair that would completely fulfil his vision at any local stores. This blew me away because it demonstrated what I always knew—Jose is a person that will work extremely hard to turn his vision into a reality; by no means will he ever take the easy road but, rather, one that will allow him to expand his skills and knowledge in unimaginable ways. In this case, Jose learned how to sew, create sewing patterns, and construct a pair of jeans that would fulfill his needs and vision. As a daughter of a third generation seamstress, I know for a fact that this is no easy task! The amount dedication, patience, and perseverance he demonstrated by doing this is simply astounding. What often takes years to master, he was able to do in just a few months, all thanks to his willingness to improve what was not working for him.  \r\nThis example demonstrates that Jose is constantly seeking to solve issues and problems in all areas of his life, not just in his professional career and actively works to enhance his life by solving problems in innovative ways. It, too, shows his willingness to learn from new situations and his ability to see the opportunity for growth in every problem.\r\n',5,'I first met Jose in 2011, when he was still trying to enroll in college to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. After looking at several of his options, he decided that going to our local community college would be the best road for him, this way he would be able to increase his GPA, adapt to the college life, and start making meaningful connections within the college and university. In a community where many students are discouraged to attend college because of a difficult and confusing enrollment process, costly tuition, and lack of many available courses, Jose thrived and continued his education after not having attended for many years. He also obtained a part-time job to be able to pay for classes and often seeks help from STEM UP, a program that prepares students to make the transition from community college to a four-year university. His ultimate goal is to transfer to the University of New Mexico to finish his undergraduate career. \r\nUnfortunately, the state of New Mexico has one of the lowest retention and graduation rates when it comes to college students at our local schools and universities; these numbers being specially low for men of color. According to the statistics, Jose is doomed for failure but when I interact with him I do not see a statistic, I see a young man who is incredibly passionate about making a difference through computer science and programming while also sharing his skills with others. Jose has proved to be one of the most resilient young men I have ever met and, without doubt, will soon obtain his Bachelor’s degree. His positivity, enthusiasm, and eagerness to learn will allow him to gain the all the tools needed to overcome any obstacles and reach a very much deserved success.

His maturity and easy-going persona are two of the most helpful attributes that have allowed Jose to connect with his peers and greatly help others. A most prominent example of his ample experience with mentorship is through his interaction with fellow employees at the Home Depot. At work, Jose takes a special interest in helping new employees who, often times, need a extra guidance navigating their way through the store, with product knowledge, and customer assistance. Jose never hesitates to go the extra mile to help those who may be finding themselves in a challenging situation, and this makes him a great leader in all aspects of his life. ',5,'I am constantly amazed at the vast versatility Jose constantly continues to display through every one of our interactions. He is not afraid to step out of his comfort zone and be exposed to new ideas and challenges.  The first instance that comes to mind that reflects Jose’s curiosity on how the world works took place two years ago. A student from our local community had the incredible idea of starting a new local radio station that would serve as a new outlet for more interesting and relatable content for young people in the Albuquerque area. Jose became instantly thrilled with the possibility of being part of this incredible project and started figuring out different ways to make this happen. He learned and studied the available opportunities to turn this student’s dream into a reality and began gathering more knowledge on radio communications. This is just one of the countless experiences I’ve had where Jose has displayed a wonderful curiosity and, by doing such, he has expanded his knowledge of the world and our community.',5,'It was approximately a year ago that I saw a lot of growth from Jose when he actively started seeking further opportunities for his own personal and professional advancement. He began to regularly visit STEM UP, a program and department at the local community college that prepares and guides students through the transition to a four-year university. Jose also started asking friends, teachers, and community organizers about scholarships, internships, summer programs, and jobs that would allow him to, not only increase his knowledge in computer science but, put into practice his professional skills. Jose constantly continues to impress me with his ability to reach out to others and create deep and meaningful connections that allow him to feel comfortable asking for help.','One specific challenge I foresee Jose facing in the future is having make the connection between his interest in coding and how it can be used for community organizing. As of now, there are not many outlets in New Mexico where coding can be used as a means of activism. I truly believe that Jose is the perfect candidate to start creating these outlets, empower youth, and create the opportunities that we desperately need for various local organizations working on social justice issues, youth, parents, and many other community members to see coding and the usage of other technology as a way to raise their voices to new heights. Providing the necessary training on alliance building, networking, and positive youth development would allow Jose to start using coding and computer science to improve communities throughout the state of New Mexico and the country.','It is my belief that the best way for Code for Progress to support Jose Vazquez through his journey in this leadership program, professional career, and educational efforts would be to connect him with individuals in New Mexico or surrounding areas that have, in some way or another, experienced some of the same challenges as him or have already established a successful career in computer science.

We first met around the time of the Queer People of Color Film Festival, of which she was the main organizer of. She has used her photography skills to document protests, events, and most importantly, people who tend to be invisible to the mainstream media. She did an amazing photo documentary about the little known Afro-Turk population of Turkey, and used the film to educate people in the United States about this important and often ignored community. ',5,'Andrea is the definition of a self-starting problem solver. There are not many people who, in the face of significant financial hardship, can say that they had an Ivy League education and a fully-funded trip to Turkey. Andrea is someone who can do a lot with very little. She has virtually no access to resources from her parents, and has subsisted by working in coffee shops and grocery stores while she was in school. And yet, she never gave up on her education. She took it very, very seriously, and has worked to pursue her love of languages in a myriad of ways. ',5,'Andrea essentially taught herself Arabic. Before she even though about applying to Temple University or University of Pennsylvania, she was speaking Arabic with the small shop owners of Middle Eastern stores. She would be frustrated by her accent, or a mistake in her grammar, but would always persevere, asking for help when she needed it, and ultimately, when she realized she had taught herself as much as she could, looked to attend the best-fit language program she could find at the University of Pennsylvania. Furthermore, as previously indicated, Andrea has struggled to find gainful employment(I believe largely due to discrimination based on her race and income status). The nature of the jobs available to her, even with her tremendous skill set, is that they are low-paying, with no health benefits or other social supports. Even still, Andrea has held down two or three jobs at a time, even while in school. ',4,'Andrea has always tutored others in Arabic, and is a very warm, sharing person. I have always known her to have a \"men-tee\", someone she was tutoring or helping. Andrea is a natural teacher; she is patient and understanding and yet pushes the people she is working with to do their best work. She has put her Arabic skills to work by teaching part-time, and while she readily admits the challenges of teaching, she has found it to be one of the more meaningful ways for her to share her love of the language. ',5,'Certainly, her natural curiosity about languages and linguistics is a perfect example. It is impossible to teach yourself how to write, read and speak such a difficult and intricate language as Arabic without that curiosity. However, there are additional examples that should be noted. Part of the reason that Andrea became interested in Arabic in the first place is because she was curious about what it meant to be an Arab, especially in the era after 9/11, where Arabs and Muslims were targets of discrimination and violence. I think she wanted to know more about that society and culture, and how it relates to ours. Her photography is another great example. She taught herself another difficult skill, and has used it to capture some of the most beautiful portraits of people I\'ve seen. Her subjects are always candid, and typically people who are underrepresented in media. I do think her photography has a lot to do with her curiosity about people. She is great at capturing little lost moments, people in pensive and vulnerable poses, and sides of people not typically seen. It is a special gift that I rarely see in others. ',5,'Andrea is a survivor. As previously noted, she has achieved amazing progress, and completely against the odds. When she was trying to get into Penn, she contacted everyone she knew who could help her. When she wanted to go to Turkey, she went to meetings of the Turkish Society in Philadelphia to ask for help with scholarships and advice. She takes her work very, very seriously, and part of that is asking questions, making sure she is on task, and participating in group processes that make her work easier. She is naturally at ease with people and not even a little shy, which I think helps when it comes to asking for advice or guidance. On a more emotional level, she typically comes to others when she has a question or problem, and I have never known her to \"stew\" or to keep things to herself. ','I would be remiss if I did not mention that Andrea has definitely struggled with areas of depression and self-esteem. Emotionally, she is someone who really needs a lot of love, support and positive feedback (I absolutely cannot confirm this, but I suspect she may have a history of abuse). She relies on the support of people in really significant ways, and community is very, very important to her. She is extremely sensitive to passive-aggressive behavior. She is excellent at taking constructive criticism, but it is important that it is direct and pointed, and in the context of an overall supportive environment, one in which her success is part of the goal.  ','See above! Like I said, give her constructive criticism, but in a direct fashion, not in the form of subtle punishments that leave room for interpretation. She has had a few jobs that have behaved that way (cutting her hours when she made a mistake, for example), and it was extremely difficult for her. I will use this space to make a final plug for Andrea, as I think she is truly perfect for this program. Coding is such a natural fit for her, as it is a language just like Arabic. Her skill will be unmatched, I am sure. Her commitment to social justice work, and building a society where people like her are valued and appreciated suggests that her values and the values of Code for Progress are perfectly aligned. Six months ago she was discussing an idea for an app she had that would help people learn languages and build bridges across the globe. She expressed an interest in learning to code, but wasn\'t sure where to start. I\'m so, so happy she found Code for Progress. Andrea is a queer woman of color, and there are so few people like her in the world of technology. She would bring such a neat perspective to others in the program.

She has endless enthusiasm and energy to make these flows better, even small improvements bring her (and those they benfit) joy.',5,'To be frank, Dru has had some trouble finding stable employment through no fault of her own. Philly is a tough city for jobs, let alone for someone who\'s unique skill set isn\'t as marketable as someone with a solid career history. And although she is sensitive and vulnerable around this topic, she has put her best effort into researching employment topics. Her friends, neighbors and of course, the internet are mined for help.

As we conveyed very consistently during the campaign, Senator Booker does not avoid problems, instead he runs toward them, and the story of Newark, New Jersey is one of challenges but also of hopes. George Hayward recognized all of this and point a point of joining our team to help make a difference and elect a man who personally understands the struggles of discrimination and poverty seen in communities across the nation like Newark. I think George’s work on our campaign underscores his commitment to these values. George was widely involved in several different aspects of the Booker campaign, from finance to policy to advance - but always had the same motivation behind his involvement. He consistently spoke to me about his dedication to progressive causes and leveling of the playing field for all parties. \r\n',5,'George has great problem-solving skills and I started to rely heavily on him for quick \"fixer\" problems on the campaign; he had such a get-to-yes attitude. Campaigns are a lot like startups in that team members have to wear many hats and given that plans require constant adjustment based on what is happening locally and around the state, and what is dominating day’s news cycle. George was great at adjusting to tasks at hand based on a good read of the team\'s needs and temperature, etc. In one case, I remember we were sending out hundreds of thank-you letters to some of the campaign’s donors and we ran into a snag. We had dumped the donor addresses from an online database into Excel but many of the addresses were not capitalized correctly, and some donors had inputted their phone numbers into the field for zip codes. George looked up a bunch of Excel text string formulas and even consulted with our data team to make sure he found the proper solutions to not only band-aid but transform the situation. After he corrected the addresses for the mailing, we gave him that task for the rest of the campaign. \r\n',4,'I think George stood out in terms of the patience he demonstrated during the campaign ... especially among his peers. I saw this most clearly in the Advance work he did. An important part of any major campaign is “advance,” where members of the campaign set up events for the candidate, the audience and the press. George worked the gamut of events ranging from meetings with small groups at colleges, to the victory speech at the New Jersey Preforming Arts Center in October. In these scenarios, the combination of patience coupled with urgency is a must. There is a focus and pressure required to set things up in a short time period, but there is a patience needed when the candidate is running behind schedule or when a site does not have the functionality it was supposed to have. George dealt with these hiccups professionally and showed great patience in doing so.\r\n \r\n',5,'George demonstrated solid and genuine teaching and mentoring skills during some opportunities here or there around the office, and during big events. I know he helped a number of the younger members of the campaign with college questions and cover letters. And when we\'d be working on events together, I would often deputize George as someone who could then go on and train the next batch of fellows or volunteers. In a very specific example, George also showed a number of people on the campaign how to use his string functions in Excel. I think George has demonstrated quite strong interest in mentoring and teaching others. \r\n',5,'When George came aboard the campaign his curiosity definitely stood out. He wanted to work in every part of the campaign and spoke to members of each team. He carried out assignments for our Digital team, Communications team, Advance team, Finance team, Policy team, and even our Field team. George showed legitimate interest in how each team executed its goals and how each made a contribution to the campaign as a whole. George left the Booker campaign with a strong sense of what a sophisticated political campaign looks like thanks in no small part to his curiosity. He almost approached the campaign like a PhD student - to help paint a picture.\r\n',5,'George asked me for help as needed, and on a campaign of this scale, it is crucial to ask for help. With press questions daily and with close scrutiny on the campaign, we ask all fellows on the campaign to check in with us when things are even slightly unclear. George always asked questions in this capacity, and over time he earned assignments which required more confidentiality.  In fact, eventually we asked George to help with the physical redactions on ten years of Senator Booker’s tax returns. \r\n','George can be a bit of a perfectionist. One thing George worked on was adapting to a campaign environment which was not always scripted. Sometimes, he ended up having to produce projects under deadline even if they weren\'t absolutely perfect and up to his standards. Ultimately, it\'s a good problem to have and one that he really let to a great deal of growth on his part.\r\n','I know that George is deeply curious.

Some members of the committee felt that allowing media coverage in the event would increase its sponsorship because companies could generate good publicity.

It is specifically MCC that exemplifies Brian\'s approach to the issues mentioned above. Brian sought out the co-ops in part for an amplified sense of community in his hometown, but primarily because he believes passionately in their mission to provide housing options to low- and moderate-income Madisonians - including, specifically, LGBTQ individuals. It\'s easy to profess an interest in these issues, and maybe give a little money or volunteer a little time. How many are committed enough to, quite literally, LIVE in solidarity with their ideals? Not many: Brian is.',3,'I\'m going straight down the middle here, because in all honesty mine and Brian\'s relationship (colleagues in South Korea, very close friends since) has not given me adequate exposure to situations where he would have demonstrated these sorts of skills. That being said, I know Brian well enough to say that I can\'t imagine any barrier he wouldn\'t work his way through. Where others would give up, Brian will tenaciously stick it out to the finish line.',5,'Let me tell you, nothing tests your patience like navigating expat life in Asia, and after dealing with the attendant challenges in South Korea (which is comparatively smooth), Brian tackled Vietnam. Ever tried to apply for a work permit, or sign a lease, in Vietnam? I don\'t know the statistics on how many people just abandon the country rather than deal with the frustrations, but it has to be high. Brian stuck it out, after sticking it out in Korea for a year - and at the end of my year in Korea, I was ready to rip my hair out. Brian keeps a nice, cool, calm demeanor no matter the situation. With 12 years of campaign and political life behind me, I can say with confidence that I wish I\'d had a few more Brians in my professional life.',5,'As mentioned, Brian taught in South Korea for a year and then continued in Vietnam; he even took on some online tutoring pupils after returning to Madison. That experience alone probably answers your question, but to me, what elevates Brian above his peers is that AFTER his year of experience in South Korea, he decided to tackle a CELTA course in Vietnam before seeking teaching jobs there. CELTAs are tough and expensive, and it\'s not a given that the salary boost from jobs with a CELTA will be high enough to justify the course cost on earnings alone. Brian did it because, AFTER teaching in Korea for a year, he wanted to be better at the job in Vietnam. He wanted to get deeper into the theory and professional development end of teaching as a job in service to his students, rather than view it the way that most expat English teachers do: a one or two year pit stop between \"real\" work.

I know he\'ll be equally outstanding with Code for Progress.',5,'A while ago, Brian told me he was reading, for pleasure, the same microeconomics and macroeconomics textbooks that I was using in my graduate level courses on the subject. When I asked him why, he said it was because he wanted to understand how the ins and outs of the global economy and the financial crisis were intertwined. I\'m not making that up (I\'ll be honest: I thought he was a little nuts). That, though, pretty much exemplifies the level of Brian\'s curiosity about that which he finds compelling. I already mentioned that he didn\'t just take an interest in RENEW and MCC: he joined their boards. He likes breaking a problem or organization down to figure out where the friction points are, and figure out ways to push past it. He has an insatiable curiosity and a drive for self-betterment that I both admire AND envy. These are traits that will serve Code for Progress well with Brian as a participant.',5,'Once more, I compare Brian to myself, and where I hate asking for assistance and have an unfortunate habit of rejecting suggestions for improvement, Brian couldn\'t be more different. He has a keen interest in seeking out input from people whose opinions he trusts, and taking that input to heart.

What do we get? We work 80 hours a week, have no insurance, no pensions, and get nowhere. If that seems like a personal frustration, that\'s because it is, but Brian is in the same rut as so many of us. Socioeconomically, our generation is a debt-riddled basket case, and opportunities are limited by that financial quagmire.

Through the resources and networks available at HRC, Sam is able to provide leadership development opportunities to low-income LGBT students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Her goal is to empower young people with the tools and mechanisms needed to cultivate safe and affirming spaces on their campuses. Since her tenure at the organization, I have seen an increase in organizing on college campuses as well as participation of Trans students in HRC programming.',5,'Samantha is constantly seeking innovative ways to address disparities, particularly those faced by marginalized communities.  An example of such innovation can be seen in the HBCU LGBT digital resource project.  As Historically Black Colleges and Universities started to open LGBT resource centers they were left without adequate reading material. Since funding has always been an issue for HBUCs, the online archive would be a way that students and faculty members can have access to free (or affordable) reading material that is applicable to the Black LGBT experience. What is even more impressive is that this is also a great way to mobilize the Black LGBT and Ally community to invest in our historically black institutions; to house original content that is for Black LGBT people and by Black LGBT people; while making resources accessible to low income and under-resourced students.',5,'It has been my observation that Samantha works in an environment that does not have the most progressive politics as it pertains to diversity and inclusion. I have witness her, and other people of color, struggle as they try to navigate what appears to be an oppressive climate. However, Samantha being action oriented has worked to issues of racism and privilege within the organization. For example, Samantha paired up with another colleague to create an \"intersectionality brown bag lunch\" for the 2013 cohort interns. The purpose of the presentation was to discuss concepts such as power, privilege, race, and class. It begins with introducing interns to the concept of oppression and how it manifests in the lives of oppressed people (e.g. the four I\'s of oppression: institutional; ideological; interpersonal; internalized). Then they discuss the history of the term “intersectionality” which is followed by an interactive activity with the group. The presentation is concluded by discussing strategies, tips and best practices for intersectional organizing.  Attempting to encourage institutional change while simultaneously feeling isolated and marginalized requires much patience, and I admire Samantha for her efforts.',5,'As the Youth and Campus Engagement Assistant, Samantha is responsible for the management and implementation of the Historically Black College and University Summit. She inherited the program, but since her involvement, I have seen it grow substantially. This past year Samantha implemented the Strategic Mentor component. This component paired one to two students from the 22 represented HBCUs with community leaders to develop an action plan that the students can take back to their campuses and implement throughout the 2013-2014 school year.  This program is an example of how dedicated Samantha is to building a strong pipeline between youth and the guidance of a mentor.',3,'My experience with Samantha as it pertains to her curiosity is seen mostly in her community organizing.

Thus her ability to identify the movable middle, and create strategies to sway them in the favorable way. ',3,'Samantha is an amazing resource, and has no problem asking for help on behalf of others. However, it is my opinion that she could improve on her ability to ask for help for herself. Understanding her personal background, she has come from a family structure where she was forced to figure things out on her own.

In this course, Hadar was introduced, for the first time, to feminist theory, which tries to understand, explain, and interrogate difference and inequality, providing salient critiques of power relations and privilege. In order for students to fully understand the theories and concepts introduced in the course and to adequately develop their own critiques, they must practice intense critical reading, thinking, and writing. While some students were inclined to express their frustration with the rigorous work load, Hadar opted to give her best effort throughout the term. To say that she performed at an above average level would be an understatement. Her contributions during class are always effective and engaging, provoking intellectual questions and responses from both me and her classmates. Although much of the class content had been foreign to Hadar prior to her enrollment (she was a science major when she first took my course), she often assumed a position of leadership in the classroom, and her interactions with classmates were always respectful, helpful, and informative. I only score her 4/5, because she\'s still learning and growing.',5,'Hadar has a unique ability to consider intellectual frameworks distinctly different from her own.  Engaging with the content in my course must have always proved difficult for this reason, but she persistently insisted on working through this in order to produce the best work possible. She most eloquently exemplified this in response to our discussions about the ways in which race and gender converge with privilege. She was able connect the complex issue of privilege to more familiar ideals, such as American individualism and exceptionalism. More specifically, in an informal essay examining a current event, she wrote, “Western individualism teaches us not to see how, as a member of a group, we oppress other groups, but to see ourselves as people that do or do not oppress others individually. Thus, even if we do recognize the gravity of oppression, we only think of our individual acts that we deem ‘fair’ or ‘helpful’ or the opposite to oppressed groups. We do not consider how our privileges affect less privileged groups.” Reading her response, and being aware of her own personal struggles with her racial privilege, alerted me to her unique ability to consider intellectual frameworks that challenged her very own—an approach that usually provokes tremendous difficulties for first-year students.',5,'I want to reiterate the above example, because I was especially impressed with Hadar’s ability to produce writing that was insightful, well-developed, organized, and highly analytical despite her inexperience with the subject matter—so much so that I have recommended that students work with her on improving their own rhetorical skills. Hadar is able to critically assess the debates and discussions relevant to whatever topic she is pursuing and to take a position on the issue, drawing support from relevant arguments, findings, and discussions extracted from the syllabus and her own research. This illustrates her ability to evaluate research materials based on her critical assessment of the evidence provided in the conversations she examines.  Hence, she is always able to reference appropriate examples, as well as to make linkages between the examples presented in the essay and the concepts, theories, and topics discussed in the course.',4,'Hadar’s interests in teaching and mentoring others were solidified when she served as a Journalist for the team magazine project in my course. Her team produced New Leaf, a magazine that aims “to educate women on the greater impacts they can have to help themselves and the environment and why these connections are, or should be, important.” In addition to ensuring that all of the requirements were met in her capacity as Journalist, Hadar also helped her team to creatively provoke reflection/discussion via nuanced/provocative analyses. New Leaf provided clear and concise arguments/theses, along with critical interpretations of myriad existing discourses about ecology and feminism. Along these lines, her team was able to address points of tension/contrast that were fruitful for the class to analyze, debate, and/or resolve. Due to their level of preparation, the significance and effectiveness of their magazine, and the degree to which they were able to open up critical issues, themes and idea, her team earned an A. Additionally, Hadar received a 10/10 from her teammates, which is a testament to her ability to encourage her classmates to push themselves beyond the comforts of their own intellectual paradigms, something she also regularly requires of herself.

In response, Hadar wrote, “Recently, I started noticing how media had manipulated me, and much of television and movies became quite ruined for me. In response, I cut over a foot of my hair. I wanted to see what it was like having hair that short. With short hair, people see my face before they see my hair. My style, expression, and feeling of comfort with myself have blossomed. Now, I want to learn about how my noetic—almost spiritual—experience ties in with the rest of the world: what it means in history, for current issues and conflicts, and for future progress.” I appreciated her response, because, while her approach to addressing gender inequality may be interpreted as immature or naïve, she is committed—nonetheless—to learning about how we theorize gender. She is curious about how people perform gender and how that affects their place in the world. ',5,'I often find myself resisting American individualism when I have conversations with students about seeking necessary help during their struggles by any means necessary. This conversation usually arises when students express their frustrations in class without having taken advantage of my office hours, time dedicated specifically to students who are struggling in class.

She took advantage of office hours nearly every session. Once, she came to speak to me about the challenges she was facing while trying to complete the reading assignments. Another time, she wanted to better understand how I navigate popular myths about feminism and my own commitments to feminism. She once came to speak with me about an upcoming assignment—the Current Event Analysis—and how she could most effectively theorize what had been happening in the world with assistance from the theories we’d engaged in class. Finally, she came to talk to me one day about life. This tends to happen more often on liberal arts campuses. She just wanted to talk about how she could affect change in the most effective ways possible. Throughout the session, I came to expect these talks between me and Hadar.

In the double coming out forums that Dago routinely leads, for example, a panel of participants who have multiple invisible identities discuss their experiences coming out as undocumented and queer, and in some cases as a third identity that falls within the trans umbrella (e.g., gender queer, drag queen, tansgender, etc.).  The stories that emerge during these forums highlight financial burdens, social ostracizing regarding perceived gender nonconformity, and racial profiling in Arizona, among other issues. Dago ensures that QUIP events are as accessible as possible, such as translating meetings in Spanish and American Sign Language for members, and developing programming that is financially accessible for all members to attend.

I have seen him immediately implement the feedback provided that he found to be useful and relevant.  One example of this is a sign that had been hung in the QUIP office during a retreat that could be seen as sexist by some.

However, perhaps what is most remarkable about Carmen is not her passion for youth leadership and development, nor her initiative in constantly looking for new opportunities to serve her community, but rather, how her background as a woman of color has strengthened her belief in social justice through policy.\r\n\r\nRecognizing Carmen’s drive for infusing youth development with community development, she was selected as the youngest Board Member of the Chinatown Community Development Center.  Serving on the Board of Directors, Carmen leverages her unique lived-experiences growing up as a young person from the neighborhood to help define the strategic goals to be mission-driven while balancing organizational needs.  She has demonstrated an ability to think critically about the nuts and bolts behind development of affordable housing: the complex financing, land-use, the politics of zoning, resident services and how to engage meaningfully with stakeholders in conversations about ensuring a healthy pipeline of housing stock to serve low-income residents.  More importantly, Carmen is able to look at the issue with a qualitative lens—she makes informed decisions putting the needs and voices of people first.  For Carmen, housing justice is social justice.\r\n\r\nCarmen treats her communities like classrooms without walls—I am truly inspired by her constant drive to bring service-learning front and center as an avenue for leadership development.  Through such networks as the Japanese American Citizens League and Harvard Public Policy and Leadership Conference, Carmen has dedicated her career to using policy to end racial inequalities. While studying at Cal, she advocated for new admissions policies in the University of California system that would greatly lower minority enrollment in higher education. I am proud of Carmen’s ability to navigate fluidly across different environments and her great potential to become an outspoken policy advocate for under-represented communities.',5,'Carmen leverages her personal experiences, hardship and growth as a compass for problem-solving, on a policy level.  Growing up as the only child in a single-parent household, Carmen quickly had to fill the role of serving as a backbone in the family and a cultural/ linguistic broker for her mother.  At the young age of eleven, Carmen and her mother were served with an eviction notice on their San Francisco apartment.  The apartment, and the city became a battleground for her where she had to fight to stay.  She served as the translator between her mother and helped her mother to interpret what was happening, how housing law and policy was impacting their family’s livelihood.  Facing an eviction is by no means an easy experience but instead of tackling just her own case, Carmen is now committed to actively ‘solving the problem’ by serving on the Board of Chinatown CDC and putting her brainpower towards developing housing policy that protects tenants rights and the neighborhood fabric of communities, like Chinatown, facing the threat of gentrification.  She understands that her case is not an isolated one and that in order to make long-term change on the problem (real-estate speculation, tenant displacement), that there needs to be a concerted effort by activists, organizers, tenants, tenants-rights attorneys and legislators to pass policy that protects marginalized low-income tenants.  I would classify her growth from that moment as an eleven-year-old helplessly facing an eviction to her becoming an agent-of-change on housing policy as an innovative (and impactful) form of ‘problem solving’ for the greater community.',5,'When posed with obstacles, Carmen responds positively and is able to assess situations and is always motivated to overcome hurdles, with great confidence and a contagious enthusiasm.  One of the character-defining obstacles Carmen faced as a young adult was the process of gearig up and applying to college. Growing up in a low income, Asian American family and the first in her family to even consider the pursuit of higher education, Carmen lacked the social capital and family support early-on to gear up for the college apocation process. Learning how to navigate the college process and financial aid opportunities was alot to absorb for her as a teenager but then also having to quickly translate it into her mother posed challenges. Carmen was flooded with information and options, but she dealt with the process by taking a step back to digeat and organize the opportunities in a way that her mother could similarly comprehend. Ranking high on the list of concerns was the financial roadblock college would pose. Carmen literally bookmarke and applied for as many scholarships as possible to remove the burden from her mother. It is rare and inspiring to see even at an early age that Carmen worked through obstacles and new experiences, often juggling the role of adulthood,  by creating her own roadmap - in this case, it was the steps and means for getting into UC Berekeley- to reach her goals. ',5,'While working as a Tour Guide in the Chinatown Alleyway Tours program, Carmen made it a priority to train, support and facilitate workshops for younger tour guides on the history of the neighborhood.  Carmen is incredibly versed and knowledgeable in Chinatown\'s socio-political dynamics and history of organizing, but being able to \'teach\' that material to the next generation of tour guides was a priority to her.  She customized a workshop on the Fall of the International Hotel, an integral part of Manilatown, a Filipino community adjacent SF\'s Chinatown.  She put a great deal of effort into creating a presentation and creating appropriate questions so that high school students could understand the heart of the struggle and issue.  Carmen also budgeted time outside work to meet with young tour guides to help them improve on their public speaking by providing insights on what worked for her as a young tour guide.  Whilst leading tours, it was clear that she had a fierce passion for empowering others about the significance of her community, a place she calls home.  In her tour narrative, she is able to eloquetly weave in examples of immigrant experiences and paints the audience a clear picture of how advocacy has shaped the local color and quality of life for its reaodents today. She is a powerful storyteller -- the tours serve as a platform for her not only to share the neighborhood’s history and struggles but also her experiences as a resident and her role in shaping the future of the community.\r\n',5,'Carmen has always been guided by a curiosity to learn the nuts and bolts (the academia) behind the phenomenons and realities that were shaping the world in which she lived, in real time.  Having studied the Spanish language for over seven years, she applied her acquired Spanish-language skills to travel to Argentina, where she took classes on critical analysis of peace-building while engaging in weekly service projects. By using education in tandem with community practice, Carmen observed how service-learning reinforces both personal agency and an understanding of social issues’ structural causes.  Learning on the global level fueled her passion for wanting to act on the local level.  As a result, she adopted the concept of service-learning to her work in the Berkeley Cal Corps Public Service Center, where she served as a leader in the Alternative Breaks program.  She led a cohort of twelve participants to the San Diego-Tijuana border to study the contemporary U.S.-Mexico relationship and issues such as border militarization and environmental effects of globalization. This trip was not only an opportunity for Carmen to further her Spanish fluency but also one in which to contextualize the larger immigration debate and her personal position on the matter.  She easily could have learned, dissected and analyzed the issue from behind journalism articles and through meeting with professors on the subject but instead she chose to participate in the program because she wanted to see and understand what it looked like on the frontlines and how people’s lives were impacted.  The following year, Carmen organized and led a local Alternative Breaks program here in San Fracisco where Cal students were immersed in service-learning projects across high-needs communities including Bayview and Chinatown. She was committed to customizing the progam experience to meet the needs and interests of its participants but was also able to \'read\' the dynamics of the cohort and applied different team-building mechanisms to ensure that there was synergy in the cohort and knew how to encourage folks to step-up or step-back to create a leadership opportunity for everyone.',5,'When working on projects or in a professional capacity, Carmen knows how to identify resources and asks for help troubleshooting tasks if needed. A good example is how Carmen responded and met deliverables for the Combined Federal Campaign in Bureau for Policy, Planning and Learning at USAID for which she was hired to work on. Having never worked on CFC before, she sought guidance from people with experience such as the previous year\'s management team to glean \"lessons learned,\" the Office of the General Counsel to learn the ethics rules behind fundraising and solicitations, and the campaign vice-chairs to gauge their expectations of me and the campaign.  Rather impressively, Carmen packaged the knowledge she got from asking dor help and created an organizational chart detailing roles and responsibilities and a guide outlining steps and contingency plans to pass the baton onto future staff who may need help in their work plans. \r\n\r\nOutside of work, Carmen has developed a tight and diverse support network of close friends, sorority sisters, travel-abroad classmates, mentors and community activists with whom she can and does ask for help from. \r\n\r\nWhat I have come to respect and appreciate most about Carmen is that she is unafraid to ask for help, or admit that she is struggling with challenges that come with growing up. Perhaps what distinguishes Carmen in this area is that she seeks help and input from her peers through social media (like Facebook) and always gives context for the thought processes and real-time happenings leading up to her ask for help.  Reading through her timeline of notes and blog entries, one can be absorbed by poems that read like call-and-responses that pose questions to friends (her extended community) about how to handle and grow into transitions in life. Through her frank and open dialogues with friends and mentors, both in-person and via social media- Carmen created a space to seek out and exchange advice. \r\n','Home is where the heart is. For Carmen, this rings true because she is able to build comunity and a second-family with her peers but home is also where her family is, in San Francisco. While she now has the support of her mother to pursue her passion for policy, which has brought her to Washington DC, I believe Carmen still feels committed or responsible for supporting her family in SF and would want to budget the time to stay connected with them.','Carmen values community-building tremendously as a part of every classroom, job and internship that she has participated in.  She has done so in our youth leadership programs by being intentional about providing space(s) for peers to debrief about their learning experiences, share thoughts about things happening both in and outside of the program and through making the effort to get to know others.  I think it would help Carmen - and benefit other participants - to allow for organic community-building efforts.

Cindy is the first person to take the position of Womyn’s Programmer in over five years.  Hence, Cindy helped to revive the gender component of the Asian Pacific Coalition, which is no small feat.  In the one year that Cindy served as Womyn’s Programmer, she facilitated developments on gender issues for the staff and for our board of representatives, allowing us to expand our understanding of the intersectionalities between gender and race.  In addition, Cindy worked closely with the LGBT Programmer to put on workshops regarding the intersectionalities between gender, race, and sexuality.  Cindy’s strong presence in the Asian Pacific Coalition inspired the student leaders who followed to continue the Womyn’s Programmer position.  In this past year, the Womyn’s Programmer position continues to inspire the twenty-four Asian Pacific Islander (API) organizations in APC to consider gender issues in their programming and advocacy. Hence, Cindy played a pivotal role in the development of critical gender consciousness in the UCLA community, especially in regards to the API spaces at UCLA.',4,'During our time on the Asian Pacific Coalition staff together, Cindy has had several opportunities to demonstrate her creativity in problem solving.  As one of five members of the coalition staff, Cindy was an essential voice during our board meeting, where we discussed pressing campus climate issues.  Campus climate issues that year include: a viral video that expressed anti-Asian sentiment, deportation of students, decline in Asian American study enrollment, and the state of ethnic studies.  The Asian Pacific Coalition is considered the official voice of Asian American students on campus, which made it our responsibility to respond to these campus climate issues.  Cindy was instrumental in helping us brainstorm and develop campaigns and relevant programming to address these issues.  Her creativity helped us develop a strategy for the Chancellor meeting regarding Asian American feedback to the viral video.  We also organized students to do a calling campaign to local state representatives to stop the deportation of a student.  Finally, we developed an ethnic studies conference to bring together students, faculty and staff to discuss the current state of ethnic studies.  These campaigns and programs would not have been conceptualized and executed without Cindy’s valuable contribution. ',5,'The first time I met Cindy was in the UCLA Academic Affairs Commission.  In the 2009-2010 academic year, I served as Academic Affairs Commissioner and Cindy applied for a director\'s position.  She was appointed as the Student Support Services Task Force Director in the 2009-2010 academic year.  As a director in the Academic Affairs Commission, Cindy led the efforts to address closures to important academic resources on campus.  In 2009-2010, UCLA faced unprecedented budget cuts that led to the closure of the undergraduate writing center at UCLA.  Cindy helped lead the efforts to provide alternative writing resources through quarterly workshops.  Furthermore, Cindy helped lead the campaign to restore the undergraduate writing center.  By the end of the year, the writing center was returned to the students.  Cindy’s involvement in the Academic Affairs Commission demonstrates her patience in working through obstacles.  This was a yearlong campaign that required political maneuvering and much patience.  ',4,'As the Womyn’s Programmer for the Asian Pacific Coalition (APC) Cindy played a vital role in teaching and mentoring APC interns.  Cindy mentored two interns in her Gender and Sexuality committee and worked with them throughout the year.  They participated in her weekly talking circles and worked with her on programming.  Cindy also developed the entire internship group and staff on issues regarding gender and sexuality.  As a senior, Cindy worked closely with younger staff to help them develop their critical consciousness and their skills as organizers.

',5,'Because Alan is a DREAMer and is waiting to receive his work permit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, he has had many challenges to continue his higher education and find a stable job. However, these circumstances have not stopped him from finding ways to better himself and his community. Since he cannot get a job, a couple of years ago he became self-employed by offering his services in computer and cell phone repair to friends and family. Little by little people started to trust him for different jobs, and now he has a pool of clients who refer him all the time. I think this says a lot about his persistence, creativity, and patience. He was able to turn a challenge into an opportunity of growth. I hope Code for Progress values and encourages him to continue strengthening this resilience.',5,'Because he was priced out of a college education, Alan gives a very high value to mentorship. I have seen him at different community and special events networking, sharing his DREAMer story and meeting leaders in search for mentors. After the event, Alan makes sure to socialize with new ADAC members and makes them feel included by asking for their opinions during the debriefing of the events. \r\n\r\nDuring the “I am a DREAM Voter” campaign in 2012, besides being a team leader, Alan held one-on-ones and participated during general meetings to share tips and best practices for canvassing, registering voters, and recruiting members and volunteers. Alan motivated everyone around him, not just people in his team.\r\n \r\nI am not sure that Alan has been part of an official mentoring program, but he has definitely demonstrated interest and willingness to teach and mentor others.  I have no doubt that with some structure; Alan will be a great mentor and leader.',5,'This question makes me smile and think “Yes, this is so Alan!” Alan is the kind of person that as you finish the statement “I wonder how this works” he is already looking it up on google or c-net (or one of the websites he knows), and shares with you a video that answers your question.\r\nEvery now and then well intentioned clients will give Alan broken computers or gadgets in appreciation for his work and customer service, with the hope that he can sell them in parts and get some extra cash. Alan always welcomes these gifts with gratitude and even though sometimes he knows he cannot get much profit from them, he will take them apart to figure out what was wrong. Sometimes Alan gets lucky and finds a very easy software or hardware solution and ends up with a new working gadget. \r\nAlan is also a focused person. When he has a project, whether it is personal or professional, he will stay at it until he completes it. I believe this balance of being curious and focused at the same time has and will take him very far. ',4,'Alan might not be the kind of person who states “I need help” publicly, but when he figures out what he needs, he will research or ask around for the tool he needs to get his project done. I picture Alan participating in your program learning how to code, and when getting stuck, asking for advice from his team members and mentors on how to solve the problem instead of expecting someone to fix it for him.','Imagine being forced to leave behind everything you know at 14 years old because of a threat of kidnapping, and moving to a new country with a different language, culture, and educational system. And after learning English in a year and working extra hard to receive a high school diploma, you are priced out of a college education and placed in deportation proceedings because of a minor traffic violation.\r\nAlan is a warrior. He has faced institutional violence and oppression for a long time, and he has been very resilient. Unfortunately I suspect that Alan has internalized some of that oppression in the form of low self-esteem. Sometimes Alan will have great ideas and intentions but he might struggle to speak his mind because of a fear of being rejected or dismissed. I have no doubt that if your program creates a safe-space that is inclusive and with conscious facilitation, Alan will thrive and exceed expectations.

She encouraged and provided moral support to a family friend who was in an emotionally abusive relationship. Jamie regularly sent her empowering quotes and anecdotes of women who had left their abusers. She encouraged her to find her voice, and helped to build up her self-esteem which had been severely damaged by years of abuse. Empowering other women and mentoring young girls to assert themselves and not conform to society’s stereotypes are passions of hers.  ',4,'Due to our mother’s business experiencing a prolonged decline in profits, Jamie suggested changes in the menu. She assessed the inclination of Jamaica’s upper class members to adopt foreign trends and suggested that traditional Jamaican meals with an international influence be added to the menu, for example, jerk chicken sandwiches and jerk chicken paninis. She also suggested that happy hours be incorporated to increase alcohol sales and attract a younger crowd of professional customers. ',5,'While pursuing her dreams of entering veterinary school, it was difficult for Jamie to get a job or a volunteer position at a veterinary clinic, because they required previous experience or a vet tech license. However, she was undeterred and continued to seek out clinics in the New York City and Connecticut areas. She often applied to clinics she found online and asked me to stop at clinics we drove by, where she would drop off her resume. Jamie contacted over 100 places over an 11 month period, but to no avail. Therefore, she researched local shelters and found one that had a veterinarian on the premises. She volunteered with the shelter for over a year and was then allowed to shadow the veterinarians there.',5,'As my sisters and I struggle with fluctuating weights, Jamie implemented a Health & Fitness group for the family. She schedules and leads weekly check-in meetings and exercise sessions held on Google Hangout. She researches work out plans, healthy recipes and practices and shares them with us in an effort to support us on our journey to our desired weight goals. ',5,'Jamie appreciates that people are vastly different and whenever I share anecdotes of friends or colleagues, she almost always has a plethora of questions about them. She likes to have a complete view of people—their background, family life and beliefs—so she can understand the logic behind their decisions and reactions to different circumstances. She is always intrigued by how a person’s past experiences affect their outlook on life, how they react to struggles and letdowns and how that has affected their life. Additionally, she researches successful professionals and their stories of how setbacks, determination and fate led to their successful career. ',4,'As we planned events for Sunrise Outreach Organization, a non-profit which benefits underprivileged persons in Jamaica, Jamie spent long hours sending emails and faxes to potential donors. She was tasked with securing in-kind donations and funding for the fundraising dinner in less than two months.  She was quite focused and approached the challenge head on, however, she assessed her tasks daily and whenever necessary she reached out to me or other Sunrise Outreach members for support in completing follow-up phone calls and tracking approved donations. Through this collaborative effort, she secured over 50 in-kind donations for the event. ','Jamie is a hardworking, self-motivated person but has difficulty finding employment because of her undocumented status. ','Jamie has established a Limited Liability Company through which she is able to provide consulting services to various organizations. Connecting her to a network of professionals in the social justice movement would allow her to expand her network and would open up opportunities to gain consulting experience.',1,NULL),(862,763,115,5,'In 2010 Jamie co-founded Sunrise Outreach, a direct response to wanting to provide needed health and educational services for youth and adult members of an economically disadvantaged, rural community in Jamaica. She has fundraised aggressively for the organization by  – among other things – hosting a successful fundraising dinner and silent auction in 2010.  She recruited me to emcee that dinner and auction, and to give a motivational speech to youth of the community Sunrise Outreach serves.\r\n\r\nJamie has been vocal about gender justice, in particular, since I met her in high school.  She speaks up whenever she sees abuse of power. In recent years, however, her social activism has been centered on working for immigration justice (which encompasses gender and race justice), and mentoring young women. \r\n',5,'I witnessed Jamie’s ability to creatively solve problems in the way she managed the economic challenges she faced when she was unable to work because of being undocumented. She collected bottles and cans worth five cents each and cashed them in. She also spent significant amounts of time babysitting for her older sister. She used this money to cover her food and other basic needs. Her creativity I think shone the brightest though as she became an expert at finding via Google and YouTube, giveaways for hair products, hair tools and jewelry. With the product winnings -- I would often get emails when she had won –she was able to keep her hair healthy and neat. ',5,'Jamie has patiently worked through the significant obstacle of being undocumented in the United States. She became undocumented in 2008, due to the failings of a legal company handing he paperwork. It was two or three years before she revealed this to me.  I saw her patiently go from hiding this from me and others because of fear, to even working through her fear of traveling or having paid employment. She has since put her knowledge and skills to use in community organizing for comprehensive immigration reform, has applied for and done internships and paid jobs, and is now striving towards a career in community organization and social activism. ',5,'Jamie is invested in young girls having self-esteem and uplifting themselves above trying situations. We attended the same high school, a very wealthy Catholic school where socio-economic inequalities and class differences among students were often obvious and cause for some students belittling others.  I think this and other experiences have made Jamie passionate about mentoring young women to love themselves and achieve economic independence. Since 2012, she has mentored a young, undocumented woman – helping her to find and apply for college scholarships because this young woman did not think attending college was possible. Jamie has used my extended network in healthcare to find and connect her mentee to nurses who could offer her mentee more advice and guidance. ',5,'Jamie’s curiosity about what makes people tick is most obvious in her use of social media as a research tool for finding out everything she can about how people she regards as successful think and work towards their goals. She did this with Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist who inspired her to work through the obstacle of being undocumented and become more vocal in her social activism. Anyone Jamie admires, she researches fully using Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, You Tube, Facebook and emulates the habits or characteristics they attribute their success to. ',5,'Jamie asks for help when she needs it. While she likes to be independent, she calls upon her friends and wider network for us to help her in any of her various social justice activities. She has recruited me to emcee a fundraising dinner for and deliver a motivational speech at a non-profit organization she runs. She has also asked me to connect her to healthcare professionals in my network who can be of help to her as she searches for information for her mentee who wants to be a nurse. Additionally, in the time period Jamie was unable to work, she was not shy about calling upon her sisters to help her with housing or earning by babysitting their children.  ','I think Code for Progress should keep in mind that Jamie is working through being undocumented in the United States, an unfortunate reality that has impacted her tremendously over the past five years. Though she has stood up to and worked through this obstacle, it still means that she has to be more entrepreneurial and strategic than most other people when it comes to finding professional opportunities. ','I view Jamie as driven and smart. She is resourceful, as it pertains to working with what she has to create something better. I do think, however, that she could benefit from professional mentorship that continues after this program. As someone who has benefitted tremendously from having mentors helping me to advance my education and career, I think it is something Jamie does not have currently that could help her unleash her potential to make a significant impact in her efforts to stand for racial, gender and economic justice.

She helped the group by planning and outreaching for Free Deferred Action for Childhood arrivals clinics. The east SFV is majority people of color, immigrants and low income families. Our goal is to make sure young immigrants who qualify for relief obtain free assistance and legal help in filing for their application. Erika understands the need and traveled from many miles every week to make sure to be part of the planning. \r\n',5,'Erika is a bright young woman. She is an immigrant who found our group about a year ago by doing her own research and reaching out to us. She lives in a different county, miles away from our base. In Ventura county, her hometown, there are no immigrant youth groups that provide free assistance and resources to the community. When Erika was applying for her own DACA relief, she was not willing to pay the hundreds, even thousands, of dollars some organizations and attorneys were charging. Without being connected to many organizations in LA county, she took it upon herself to figure out the application process and decided she would file for relief on her own. She drove to LA County and attended workshops and forums to finalize her application. In the end, she received relief, and she came back to LA county to help groups, such as the SFVDT, continue providing free assistance for immigrant youth.\r\n',5,'When Erika joined the SFVDT in 2013, the  SFVDT was struggling with capacity after a few members decided to step down and left a few positions vacant. The members who remained had taken on additional responsibilities to fill in the gaps. One of the positions left vacant was our United We Dream Affiliate Lead position. This was a very important position for the SFVDT because it was through the UWD affiliate lead that we were able to plug ourselves to the federal immigration campaigns taking place mostly in Washington, DC. A few weeks after joining our organization and while she was becoming acquainted with the political language and landscape of the immigrant movement, Erika volunteered to step up to the affiliate lead position. She not only had to learn about our campaigns and work at the local and state level, now she had to take on Federal politics and keep our whole group in the loop. With a little bit of guidance from other members, she managed to catch on and within a few weeks, she was jumping on calls and representing the interests of the SFVDT at the national level. What allowed her to take such an essential position was her patience to become familiarized with terms, pieces of legislation and language used in the political arena. She continues to represent us as our affiliate lead and it is amazing how far she has gotten within a year of being involved.  \r\n',4,'Erika has demonstrated her passion for teaching others while she has worked with the SFVDT. One example is her involvement in our Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals application clinics. After learning the process herself and filing for herself, she decided to join our immigrant rights organization to continue guiding others through the process. She participated in her first DACA clinic during summer of 2013 and it was then that I saw that passion. She was willing to take any role in the clinic and was in charge of helping with the screening of applicants. I was impressed of what she was able to do, given that she had not volunteered at any of our previous DACA clinics. After this, the group decided to include Erika in the planning of other events that were focused on community education to allow her to develop her passion to teaching the community.\r\n',5,'As I previously mentioned, Erika decided to take on a role in an organization that was completely new to her. She decided to become our United We Dream affiliate lead when we most needed it. This demonstrated her tenacity and eagerness to figure out the structures of organizations in such short period of time in order to work with her community. Not only did she need to learn our structure, our community work and our statewide campaigns, she also had to figure out and navigate through a national organization which had their own campaigns and structure. We were surprised, but happy and willing to help Erika navigate through both organizational structures. She proved to the whole group that any person is capable of taking on roles regardless of how long they have been involved. \r\n',5,'Erika, received her DACA relief soon after it was implemented. However, she did not pay any organization or attorney ridiculous amounts of money for their assistance in what is a rather simple process. Instead, Erika decided to seek for help. She went out of her way to look for immigrant rights organizations, most of which were in a different county, to receive free guidance. She found the help that she needed from our sister organization Dream Team LA. She then proceeded to file for the relief herself. She was successful and has demonstrated that all applicants are able to file for DACA without paying extra money for attorneys, and it is possible to go through the process on your own with some guidance.\r\n','Erika is a immigrant rights leader who has demonstrated her passion to work with the immigrant community and take on roles essential to our organization.

In various sessions where I have had the opportunity to observe Mario present his research or train other students,  I have witnessed a budding educator who is confident, articulate and well-prepared. Mario has also presented to my classes and has been part of training initiatives for low-wage workers to discuss the highlights of DACA (Deferred Action for Early Childhood Arrivals) or access to higher education for undocumented youth. Each time I was extremely impressed at the level of professionalism, preparation, knowledge, and enthusiasm that Mario demonstrated on the topics of DACA, the California and Federal Dream Acts and undocumented student experience and access to higher education. ',5,'Mario is known by his peers as a person who is willing to listen and lend a hand. He has mentored and supported many cohorts of undocumented students at UCLA and in local LAUSD high schools as part of a commitment to breaking the cycle of high Latino/a youth drop out rates and building up the self-worth of a young community who face the daily fear of deportation or detention of themselves or a family member. Mario has supported countless students in finding basic resources to be able to make it through another semester at UCLA. This includes private foundation or donor support to working with the inter-faith UCLA clergy to set up a food pantry, student center and resting space for hungry and often overworked undocumented students. Mario is always available to talk with his colleagues and is equally willing to support fellow students and immigrant families in their struggle for social and economic justice. ','Mario is a gifted organizer, student, mentor and activist. This often cares many expectations and commitments to work long hours, have an open phone line to needy peers, develop action plans and organizing campaigns that are complex and very politically charged. \r\nWhile Mario has been able to handle multiple agendas and projects, I think a challenge for Mario has been how to say no, how to focus on his own self-care and how he can feel accomplished even when he can\'t take on all the social ills facing immigrant communities. I guess I would say that Mario has a very big heart and a challenge for him is to find personal and professional balance when both of these worlds are so intimately inter-connected.  ','Mario would benefit greatly from a supportive learning community that embraces diversity, analyzing complex and intersectional realities and can work with young leaders to develop action strategies and plans that can be applied to the communities where they work. Mario has a lot to offer a program as yours. I think your program could support him by recognizing the great sacrifices that immigrant families make to contributing to U.S. economy and social well being of this nation. For the past 15 years Mario has only seen his mother Saturdays (her one day off) as she is a live-in housekeeper with a affluent family in Los Angeles. He has lived with aunts, cousins, distant family members and friends in order to get through school.  In Los Angeles, many immigrant youth live under similar situations and recognizing the hard work he and his mother have put into his education and next career choices is an important way to support such a bright young leader and student.',1,NULL),(902,814,528,5,'Although I have never taught Mr. de Leon in the classroom, I have known Mr. de Leon for a little more than one year and had the opportunity to observe him as a teacher. I first met Mr. de Leon in fall 2013 when a colleague recommended him as a tutor for my two children. From our first meeting, I had full confidence that Mr. de Leon was going to prove to be an asset in my children’s academic lives. Mr. de Leon is soft-spoken but determined, creative, kind, and passionate about education. He brings to his work a commitment to social justice and educational equity that I deeply appreciate. In the year that Mr. de Leon has worked with my children he has proven to be a skilled teacher. In particular, he has been able to meet each of my children’s distinct educational needs while developing their critical thinking skills in terms of questions of justice and equity. Beyond the range of topics that he has been able to cover – algebra, Spanish, social studies, technology, computer programming --, Mr. de Leon shows a gift and aptitude for teaching the intangible skill of social inquiry as an essential approach to all forms of learning. For example, Mr. de Leon does not teach my child \"Spanish\" rather he engages him, in Spanish, on questions of water rights in Central America. I have been so impressed with Mr. de Leon’s impact upon my own children’s education that I recruited him for a tutoring program that I helped coordinate at a local elementary school during 2012/13. Throughout the year, Mr. de Leon proved to be a leader among the group of university students recruited to serve as tutors for our after-school educational enrichment program. In particular, Mr. de Leon played a key role in helping us to design a curriculum to meet our students’ needs. Blending social justice questions with city planning, statistics, and geometry, Mr. de Leon designed a project, which helped our students build math skills while learning about and questioning the community in which they live. \r\n\r\nAlso, as you have probably read in his application materials, Mr. de Leon is regularly involved in a variety of social justice projects. He was a key organizer of the Dream students at UCLA and, now, is a volunteer for local educational projects. Having read your organizational materials, I really cannot imagine a better fit for your program than Mr. de Leon. For the year that I have known him, we have often talked about his commitment to blending social justice organizing and math/technology education. He will soar with the opportunity to participate in your program and, in turn, your program -- and the many people and projects you serve -- will soar to new heights with his engagement.',5,'As a member of the teaching team for our after-school program, Mr. de Leon was a leader in terms of negotiating hurdles ranging from scheduling to curriculum. A problem, according to Mr. de Leon, is a question and an opportunity to change rather than a barrier.',5,'As mentioned above, Mr. de Leon is soft-spoken but not timid. The tone and pace of his everyday speech reflects his overall patience with both projects in all stages and people of all ages.',5,'see above',5,'Mr. de Leon focuses on questions rather than answers, a reflection of his curiosity about everything from robots to city planning.',5,'Yes. Mr. de Leon has very strong communication skills. While capable of great independence he is not afraid of asking for help, when needed.','I really can\'t think of an intellectual or professional challenges.','If he were to leave Los Angeles, maintaining family commitments/ties may be an issue for Mr. de Leon but I am not sure. I am confident that he would leap at the opportunity to participate in your program if offered a position but helping him to support family ties may be useful.',1,NULL),(903,817,98,4,'Katherine has been a part of the Red Hook Initiative and its programs almost since its inception 10 years ago. RHI is committed to solving these issues, and all of Katherine\'s work while a participant dealt with these issues directly or indirectly. Along the way I am certain she learned why and how to do this work, and feels strongly about it. She also comes from a family committed to the work and understands the complexities and inequities of an unjust system.   ',4,'Katherine has remarkable style and flare in all that she does. While supervising her work as a Digital Steward, I have often seen her propose ideas and solutions that move our work forward. When South Brooklyn Community High School, a critical site for one of our wireless routers was uncomfortable with its students having access to WIFI in the classroom, Katherine proposed only using the site as a relay for the network- allowing us to expand into that area of our neighborhood without providing an access point for the students. Also a former student, her explanation and proposal to the high school administrators secured us the location.',3,'Katherine can get frustrated by challenging tasks and incorporating constructive criticism, the latter especially during creative tasks, as she has a strong sense of her own creativity. I do not think she has had very much experience with peers or mentors who she has been able to trust, a symptom of growing up in an unsupportive and unequal system of housing and education. \r\nHowever, I have seen much growth in this area throughout her year as a Digital Steward. She has made strides in working with others to solve complex problems, and when working by herself, she does quite well in completing her tasks. Unlike others, when we used CodeAcademy to learn HTML and CSS, Katherine rarely asked for support, instead figuring it out herself or researching the solution. ',5,'Katherine has always shown remarkable ability to share her knowledge with others. She often suggests ways we can share our work with the other participants at the Red Hook Initiative and in the neighborhood. She would like to use her new found technical knowledge to start programs in her neighborhood to help younger residents take advantage of new technology. I believe this comes from her experience as a Peer Health Educator during her teens at the RHI. In that program she designed and facilitated workshops teaching younger students about reproductive health. ',4,'This is a difficult question, but I will answer as best as I can. Katherine is eager to problem solve, and is eager to take on new assignments. She excelled at learning HTML and CSS code using CodeAcademy. She also customized our Tumblr. ',5,'Katherine tends to finish her work quickly, but rather than wait for me to ask, she brings it to me for the next step. When on assignment, she calls me to report when there are problems. For our wireless network project, we have a listserv we write to in order to get assistance for difficult to diagnose issues in the network. Katherine is often the person to contact that list and help get the problem fixed. I believe if she is surrounded by supportive experts in their field, she will take that opportunity to learn as much as she can.','Katherine is the mother of a 3 year old boy, Jesse. As a parent myself, I can only imagine the time spent in DC may be a challenge for her. I have spoken with her about this, and she wants to dedicate herself to taking full advantage of the program. She always has had the support of her mother and sister in raising Jesse, and she has spoken with them about this opportunity and they encouraged her to take advantage. Being away from home and her family could be difficult, but the distance between NY and DC is not so far that a train or bus couldnt provide a brief visit. ','Katherine grew up in the Red Hook public housing, which can be a challenging place to grow up. Young people here do not get the same exposure to role models, support systems, quality education, and job opportunities as many others in New York City.  Katherine, in my opinion, is unsure sometimes how to take full advantage of those situations. I believe for Katherine to be successful she needs a very supportive environment where there is very little hostility, or patience for it. Katherine is wary of trusting people, and this occasionally gets in the way of her development. \r\nHowever, I am constantly impressed with Katherine\'s ability to speak with others. We have attended many networking events, held meetings, and traveled to conferences in Detroit and Berlin. At each of these events Katherine was comfortable talking to all types of persons, telling them about our work and being genuinely interested in theirs. When I read about this program, knowing that Katherine would be introduced to a host of new people and skills and away from Red Hook for an extended period of time, I felt strongly that this may be the best opportunity Katherine has to focus and redefine herself. She appears determined to do so, and having seen flashes of her professional self, I know she can succeed. ',1,NULL),(904,818,98,5,'Social justice underpins all of Kathy\'s work. Kathy applied to the Digital Stewards program because she wanted to learn more about technology, believes that it is a key tool in social justice work and community organizing, and believes that equitable access is an issue of digital justice. Kathy has been the driving engine behind getting the Digital Stewards work more known about in the community - taking the lead on community outreach and engagement, speaking at conferences, troubleshooting problems with the wireless network. At both the Allied Media Conference in Detroit and the International Summit for Community Wireless Networks, she engaged with the media justice community and wireless networking community to help them understand how a project like Red Hook Wifi is working to address access / digital divide issues in her community, provide job training to young adults, and connect the community better through the network.',5,'Kathy is a very curious and driven person. Every time we have introduced new topics in the Digital Stewards program such as a basic introduction to HTML or learning how to use command line tools to troubleshoot and remote administrate the network, she dives into the subject by doing research online. She, along with another peer, lead the maintenance coordination for Red Hook Wifi -- regularly troubleshooting problems, and communicating ideas/issues with the technical team at the Open Technology Institute. Kathy applied similar creative thinking to the outreach and community engagement brainstorming. She came up with the idea of throwing block parties in the neighborhood for letting people know about the wireless network and teaching them how to connect to it.',4,'The Red Hook Initiative is a really interesting organization that focuses on youth programming to create change from within the neighborhood. Over 95% of the staff at the Red Hook Initiative are residents from the Red Hook Houses (New York City Housing Authority - Public housing). While this is an amazing community based organization model, it also present a challenging environment at times in so much that multiple generations of families often work at various levels in the organization - blurring the family and work lines. As I\'ve highlighted in the other questions, Kathy is an extremely driven young woman with great creativity and problem solving skills. The only time I have seen her have trouble is related to the family-like structure of the environment at RHI. One of the reasons I feel this would be a fantastic opportunity for Kathy is to allow her to explore her passions in a new environment, where she can have the space and opportunity.',5,'As the Digital Stewards program has expanded and brought on more team members from the high school programs, Kathy has show leadership in mentoring the younger team members in their skills - teaching them about how to work with the wireless routers and developing work plans for the team\'s community outreach work. Also, as a young mother, she mentors her son - who is a really delightful toddler!',5,'As I mentioned in the question on problem solving, Kathy has really taken to and shown passion in understanding all aspects of technology better. When we started introducing how to do things on the command line - just as iptraceroute and using SSH to remote connect to routers on the network, she got very interested in how it all works and understanding it better. She started reading about command line commands online and came back to us with questions. I\'ve seen this curiosity and analytical skill in all aspects of her work - technical and social, and in particular I\'ve really enjoyed watching her grow over the year that I\'ve worked closely with her - expanding her interest areas and skills as she learned new things.',5,'Along with a curiosity on how things work, Kathy doesn\'t hesitate to ask the questions to dig into something further. She listens well to what\'s happening around her, and is able to ask good questions both that push into an issue further or understand the context of something more deeply. ','In reviewing Kathy\'s application with her, I know she mentioned that she looks forward to the opportunity to work with an expert in the field and experience constructive criticism. I think that the Code for Progress opportunity will be great in helping Kathy experience a different environment and structure from RHI. As I was discussing earlier, the family environment at RHI can be extremely challenging - it is simultaneously a place of work, a community center, a learning environment, as well as other third spaces for a large portion of the community. I expect that adjusting to being away from her family will be both liberating and possibly personally challenging. She has excelled in working with OTI and Brooklyn Fiber closely, so I think she will do a wonderful job, but I imagine she may benefit from support in adjusting to such a new environment.','As I touched on in the last question -- mentoring and social support will be key for Kathy.

I do not have one particular example but I can say William is very community oriented. He is always involved in a cause- whether it be in his local church or at school. On campus, he was always adamant about gospel choir partnering in or showing support for various causes on campus from walks to fight against gun violence to Trenton to digging wells in Africa for safe drinking water. In all, William is willing to help any and everybody. Simply put, he has a heart for people.',5,'William was the president of an organization at The College of New Jersey called Gospel Choir. Our organization was known for hosting larger events on and off campus from concerts that involved massive budgets and planning to annual spring break volunteer trips to various states (also involving fundraising and extensive planning). These tasks all presented their fair share of problems- to name a few: getting the College to fund expensive events such as major concerts involving flying artists in from various parts of the country, fundraising to cover the costs of transportation and lodging for a group of traveling students to volunteer over Spring Break, to get other organizations to support, getting tickets sold, booking venues, getting contracts signed, the list goes on. I have watched William flourish under pressure. He is very level headed and always able to adapt, think quickly and come up with a creative solution. He well exceeds this category.',5,'I answered this for the most part. To give an example- William wanted to host a major concert on campus called Fusion of the Genres. He wanted to bring together different genres of music together on one stage to draw a more mixed, and diverse crowd from the campus. A great idea and a great cause. This cause however was pricey- from booking the campus theater, to booking the artists and sound, the College was not willing to fund a concert of this magnitude. William was relentless. He presented his case to the Student Finance Board- amended his budget several times and came up with a presentation that convinced them finally to fund this concert. This was not a small victory. The only other organization to get funding for a major concert on campus was the College Union Board which is responsible for major events on campus such as concerts. William successfully organized this concert two years in a row before graduating. ',5,'Teaching and mentoring is important when you lead an organization. While president, William implemented a mentoring program for gospel choir where a Senior leader would mentor a freshman or sophomore- to help them adjust to College life and their role in the organization. William personally mentored several freshmen who came in to the choir who later took on leadership roles in the organization. Mentoring was very important to William as he understood that these newcomers were potentially future leaders of the organization.',4,'I would say William is definitely a self-learner/ self-motivator. I think part of the reason why implementing a mentoring program in gospel choir was so important to William was because he had little preparation for his role as president. William had to learn about different campus resources and build a network of various go-to people on campus- from the campus event caterer to the campus activity director for the various events he had to oversee. Of that network, William worked to know other organizations on campus from PRISM to various cultural clubs like Asian American club. William had to also do his fair share of research and digging to find out the various Campus rules and regulations to host anything on campus and the little details like where to go to get a form and who get to sign it signed by, and all the fun responsibilities of being a leader. William also had to lead a group of not-so liked-minded leaders and figure out how to make them work well together and how to diffuse a situation before it escalated. I can think about the countless meetings in the student center until midnight debating where we should have our Spring Concert or how we would raise $10,000 for our annual Spring Tour trip on a tight deadline. William took the time to get to know his leaders very well- we listened to him, he listened to us, he delegated, and he knew when to take control. He respected us and we respected him for his hard work and for how quickly he grown into a well-rounded, resourceful President. ',5,'Delegating is an important task for a leader. Most leaders, like William, are self-motivators. William does not need anyone to push him when he has his heart set to do something, but he knows how to build a team to help his dream or vision to come to fruition. William is a great team-builder and team-player. When planning the concerts, William used his leadership team primarily, but he also used various members of the choir to help plan as well. He also knows when to ask for ideas and suggestions when he needs help planning. If unsure of an answer, he will either find it himself or ask- but he has no problem asking when needed.  ','I would say that William has improved in the area of time management from my experience with him as a fellow leader of gospel choir. Initially, William had to adjust to having to meet various deadlines such as for various forms for the events. William definitely improved in that area. He took the time to learn the various deadlines and made sure all deadlines were reinforced at meetings so nothing important was missed. He definitely grown in this area.

As a part of Students for a Just and Stable Future, she helped generate alternative proposals for re-structuring the organization to better assess its strategy and meet its goals. This included facilitating a long strategic conversation where she helped redesign the whole structure.',4,'Alli can be very good at asking for help. She gives concrete ways for others to help and speaks up when she feels she needs more help. For instance, when we were hosting a fundraiser with Tim DeChristopher, she felt that too much had fallen on her and offered specific tasks for others to take on. This makes her a very good delegator. She also knows when she needs support or further development. When she was working for the Climate Justice Hub on the Transit Justice Campaign, she realized that she needed more support so she requested a mentor from one of the member organizations.','Alli has been previously restrained by financial needs. She took time off of being a student to primarily focus on climate organizing. This has made her financially self-reliant, which can act as an obstacle at times. She makes a lot of sacrifices to do this work and it is an area I believe she needs more support. She loves the work so she can handle it well but she can become very focused and not as observant about her other needs.','Encourage her to practice self-care. Intensive programs are always a time of high output, which can come at the cost of other important needs. I am also glad that the program provides housing and stipends. This is important for enabling applicants from different economic backgrounds to participate and will probably enable Alli to gain this kind of experience.',1,NULL),(935,859,828,5,'Alli has been one of the most vocal champions for greater intersectionality in the climate justice-focused organization (Students for a Just and Stable Future) we\'re both a part of. I\'d give her the most credit of any individual for really making climate justice, not just climate change, such a key focus of our narrative. She is absolutely committed to dismantling systems of oppression and privilege in all the organizing she does.\r\n\r\nFor a more specific example of how Alli\'s commitment to justice shapes the way she lives & organizes, see this text on our website - it was edited collaboratively, but she wrote the first draft of this passage: \r\n\r\n\"While we see climate change as the most universal and longest-term threat to this vision, we acknowledge that many other very real and immediate challenges to people’s lives and well-being also exist right now. We call ourselves a climate justice organization because we recognize that a truly just world can never be achieved without an end to all forms of oppression, including but not limited to racial, gender, and class oppression. We see climate change as both an existential threat in itself as well as a symptom of these oppressive and exclusionary systems.\r\n\r\nWe draw continuous inspiration from the decades of struggle of frontline communities directly impacted by fossil fuel use and extraction. We support their struggles, and demand retribution for the past and current injustices perpetuated by the fossil fuel industry in the form of a just transition for those communities.\"',5,'I\'ve never seen Alli let herself be stopped by an obstacle. I could give a million examples, but for one: right now we\'re in the middle of planning an upcoming retreat, and our space fell through at the last minute. Alli was the first one to start piping up with alternatives while the rest of us were still (unproductively) panicking. She isn\'t afraid to think outside of the box - for example, we\'d only been looking at churches because we had used churches before, but Alli immediately suggested exploring spaces on our campuses or contacting other types of commmunity spaces. \r\n\r\nWhenever an issue crops up, you can count on Alli to come up with at least ten possible ways to solve or get around it.',5,'Like I mentioned above, Alli is an A+ problem solver. With the retreat space issue, the first reaction of some members of the group was to get visibly stressed out, or to get angry at the person who had been responsible for being in touch with the church that fell through (even though it really wasn\'t his fault). Alli, meanwhile, was level-headed and extremely patient through the whole meeting, helped us get back on track, and facilitated a very productive conversation about alternatives.',5,'Alli is a smart, talented person, but she\'s very interested in teaching her skills to other people and fostering leadership development. For example, she recently encouraged a new person to write a blog post, and very patiently and helpfully walked her through editing it. It would have been easy for Alli, who\'s a great and quick writer, to just to it herself - but instead, she used the opportunity as a chance to mentor a new member. ',5,'Alli is a visionary leader and has the ability to think through almost every piece of a campaign. She\'s great at coming up with effective messaging that gets a point across. And she is great at analyzing how organizations work - we were having a very serious structure conversation lately, and she was the first one with a coherent, sensible proposal of how we could better organize ourselves. She thinks at a systems level a lot and always has the curiosity and drive to dig to the bottom of a complicated question.',4,'Alli takes on a lot of work, and occasionally she bites off more than she can proverbially chew. I think her first instinct is to just work herself really, really hard until she gets everything done, even if that means a few consecutive all-nighters. Recently, though, I\'ve seen her being very intentional about recognizing when she\'s been given more work than one person can effectively deal with alone, and has been very good at kindly, and with advance warning, delegating tasks and asking for help. It\'s definitely something she is working on and she has made major steps, and I think she is happier and healthier for it.','Alli gives herself very high expectations and a lot of responsibility, and she constantly puts herself under a lot of pressure. As someone who has worked with Alli for a few years, I think one of the greatest challenges she is working through right now is finding a healthy balance between getting great work done and exercising self-love and self-care.','Connect her with people, let her be creative, and foster an environment where she feels comfortable asking for help when she needs it and taking care of herself when she\'s pushing herself too hard.\r\n\r\nAlli is an incredible organizer and a brilliant human being, and she is going to go a long, long way.

',4,'In making a decision, Latoya may consult friends, family, loved ones or even social media. For instance, while she was still working in Boston at a large corporate company, she often felt like the company was lacking racial/ethnic and sexual orientation diversity. She did not feel like she could be her full authentic self and knew that her fellow colleagues who identified as anything other than white cisgender heterosexuals, felt the same fear in being who they really were at work. Latoya tackled the problem head on by forming the first Diversity Working Group within the company. This group discussed and addressed obstacles to social justice within the company and helped shift the organization\'s cultural environment regarding diversity and inclusion. More employees began coming out as LGBT and fruitful discussions related to hiring more people of color began to happen.

In her book, Latoya will discuss the barriers that she experienced as a queer woman of color on a college campus, including heterosexism in the university health care system, being a black woman interested in a predominately white sorority, being a woman in a male dominated field, and being a person of color attending a predominately white university.',4,'While she was establishing the Diversity Working Group within her organization, Latoya was not only concerned about the experiences of her colleagues who were underrepresented but was also curious about the challenges that her other co-workers experienced at work, as well as how their life experiences shaped their perspectives.

We’ve been friends for a long time and I wanted the best for her.   We began to speak more about gender equality and how we as young black females are in a position to change the world and prepare it for the future.  She has since inspired me to begin writing a survival book that guides young college females through the woes of adulthood and the pressures of gender inequality.  \r\n',4,'An issue that Latoya and I constantly face, after knowing each other for so long, is staying in touch.  Attending college together made it easy, however, not living in the same state and not seeing each other regularly makes it hard to know what’s going on in one another’s life.   We started out with emails the summer after freshman year, and haven’t stopped.  Latoya suggested we get savvy and begin to use Google Hangouts.  I was skeptical at first because I was a loyal Skype user.  But, Latoya mentioned using Google Hangouts and we could add others in from our college days.  I was an instant fan and our group of gal pals enjoys seeing who’s hanging out and where, just like on campus. \r\n\r\n',4,'Since coming to understanding the meaning of “don’t cry over spilled milk”, Latoya has always been an optimist even in a crisis.  On a trip to New Orleans, our group of 4 got separated, phone batteries were on 0%, and we had no pre-planned rendezvous location for such a situation.  This wasn’t a problem for Latoya. She creatively slid past security and found herself on stage in front of thousands.  She grabbed the microphone from the bass player asking the crowd to find her friends.  With help from the crowd, she spotted me in my bright orange shirt.  We were reunited and that night became a classic story we love retelling our friends. \r\n',5,'Another pop culture reference Latoya enjoys is paying it forward.  Truly an unselfish character, if Latoya knows about it and you need help with it, she is willing to take the time to show you.  She’s like an elementary student wanting to share their favorite toys with their friends.  Technology is Latoya’s toy and sharing it with others is fun for her.  As an information systems professional myself, I know how frustrating it can be to teach others about technology and how systems work.  However, I have seen on many occasions Latoya stop what she was doing to explain a process to someone until they got the information needed.  \r\n',4,'Latoya loves food and is striving to become an elite Yelper.

Figuring out what makes people tick about their food choices is helping build her Yelp community.

Fiona was quick to remind me that entrepreneurs are female also. She was certainly right, I agreed, but the sad case is that often entrepreneurship is typically a male endeavor. She agreed with this, but lamented this fact. I believe Fiona is undertaking her work with fionateng.com/mydebtstory and her forthcoming website, ourdebtstory.is, to correct this gender injustice, even if it is only on a small scale. I am inspired by her dedication to helping young people understand their choices, and the consequences of their choices, as it pertains to student debt. Fiona understands that issues of credit and borrowing asymmetrically impact traditionally under-represented communities (including immigrants and ethnic minorities, both a part of her personal background), and Fiona is dedicated to helping empower these communities through the website she will build once she learns how to code -- ourdebtstory.is.',4,'Since we met in 2010, Fiona and I have bonded over our mutual dissatisfaction over the choices many Americans face to finance their education—including the ones Fiona and I made. While she is dedicated to paying off her loans in full, she feels, as do I, that the amount and clarity of information she received prior to borrowing for her education was woefully inadequate.\r\nNot the kind of person to simply do nothing, Fiona started fionateng.com/mydebtstory and openly shared how much she owes in an emotionally compelling and visually beautiful format. Even more inspiring, she appeared on Aljazeera America and told viewers about her challenges with her debt, and her concern for how this impacts many people of our generation. In my view, this shows a tremendous amount of personal courage.\r\nFiona wants to use ourdebtstory.is to help educate everyone, but particularly underserved communities, about the choices they have pertaining to debt and personal finance. She has taken a source of personal pain, her overwhelming student debt, and turned it into a source of inspiration and service so that others, particularly children of immigrants, minorities, and women, do not face a similar situation without better information first.\r\n',5,'I know that Fiona has had an ongoing dialogue with officers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about student loan debt, and her personal commitment to helping to build a country that better informs student borrowers, particularly those from immigrant, minority, and/or low-income backgrounds about how to manage student debt and build savings. Fiona\'s personal mission is almost identical to CFPB\'s. Although she is keen to find a way to work with CFPB on these issues, such an opportunity has yet to materialize.\r\nWhen Fiona shared this fact with me, I pointed out that she will be working on consumer financial protection whether it is with CFPB or not. She agreed -- while she continues to dialogue with them (I believe it has been months of ongoing dialogue to date), she is also moving forward with her own projects on student debt and financial health. Fiona wakes up in the morning thinking about using technology to inform and empower underserved communities to have stronger financial lives, and that is why, in my view, both CFPB and Code for Progress should have an interest in helping her succeed.',5,'Fiona\'s websites, fionateng.com/mydebtstory and the forthcoming ourdebtstory.is are both dedicated to teaching young people, particularly youth from marginalized backgrounds, about personal finance concepts, including student debt, debt service, and the importance of long-term savings. Teaching and mentoring, sharing information, are at the core of what she wants to do with her technology projects.',5,'Fiona is an avid reader and consumer of information, and I know that if she feels her knowledge is lacking in an area, she will aggressively pursue knowledge in that area. She has done this with personal finance and issues pertaining to student debt, as well as non-violent and skillful communication.

She was constantly asking her friends, including me, how we deal with our own student debt and if they had advice for how she could manage it, both emotionally and financially. I understand that while she learned a great deal, she also came to see that many people did not really have a good handle on how to manage their debt from an emotional or financial perspective.

As a result, she doesn\'t always share the same context, particularly when it comes to certain idioms or slang that she doesn\'t know.

It was a topic I knew little about and one that I have been relatively unaware of for some time. But after speaking with Fiona, I began to notice how widespread the taboo of discussing personal debt and student loan had become. Fiona had this creative idea to provide a platform where people could openly talk about their personal debt stories, sharing with others to begin to try and remove this taboo.',5,'I think everyone could learn from Fiona\'s patience and ability to ask questions. Anyone can have an idea for a new product, website, business, etc. But so few can really stick with the idea and take the time to make it a reality. Fiona has been absolutely inspirational with her commitment to bringing her ideas to life. From building relationships to reading books to taking evening courses about back-end programming, she is willing to put in the time and let things mature before forcing the subject.',5,'Fiona is a people person, but not in the traditional sense. She is always connecting people or bringing someone new along to an event. She has an amazing ability to talk with people and get to the heart of their interests. And more importantly, she always passes along information that she has acquired from her own interests. For example, I was building an EQ workshop for university students and Fiona recognized that I was looking to learn more about similar workshops. She connected me with an university contact of hers for me to inquire about programs being offered and she invited me to an empathy workshop that she was familiar with. All because she wanted to help me grow and learn more about a personal topic of interest of mine.',4,'Fiona loves information and learning. I don\'t have any personal knowledge of her \"taking things apart\" so to say, but I do know that when she gets a lead on something of interest, she takes every possible channel to learn all that she can. For example, when she began to see her idea for financial literacy matching well with the CFPB, it didn\'t take her long to know everything there was to know about the organization, the people that she needed to talk to, and setting up informational sessions with those people.',5,'One of my favorite things about Fiona is her openness. She will never hesitate to help you and she will always ask for help when she needs it.

But at times, I feel like she doesn\'t always recognize how much she\'s accomplished. I think she can get a bit blinded by how much work is still to be done and not celebrate the work that she has completed. The best example of this is when she was on Al Jazeera America to discuss student debt and the need for financial literacy. The next time we saw each other, she wasn\'t as interested in talking about the appearance, but instead the next step that she\'s working on. Sometimes it\'s important for a person to recognize their accomplishments when they\'re tackling such a large social issue.','Get her talking.

She hopes to raise awareness about the lack of education behind students loans and highlight opportunities and potential proactive steps current and future students can take to prevent a debt story. \r\n\r\nRecently, Fiona had the opportunity to share her story and commitment to raise awareness about financial literacy on Al Jazeera America.',5,'Fiona will look at a problem from all angles and more importantly she will enlist help from other, when appropriate, to help think through situations in order to come up with solutions.

Sharing her financial story has been one of her greatest obstacles, and although, she continues to work through it, Fiona persevered and worked closely with people to understand the reality of her student-loan-debt.

However, Jessica remained positive and patient throughout the entire process. ',4,'Jessica Greene is very willing to help teach others. When the school decided to start making cupcakes every month to celebrate student birthdays, Jessica quickly offered to share recipes and tips with us that would help us not only save money, but make students really feel celebrated. ',3,'Jessica Greene didn\'t seem to demonstrate a lot of curiosity about how things work until the day she told me about her love of reading. I found out that she spent many afternoons before school sitting in the cafeteria reading and rereading books, analyzing them, and finding countless reasons to leave them. I was deeply impressed with the initiative she demonstrated by consistently coming to school early and reading titles beyond those assigned in her English class. ',4,'Jessica Greene is very willing to ask for help. When I first met her she was working for the Department of Corrections as an administrative assistant. However, she left that position after she found it difficult to balance it with her course at Trinity University of Washington. She then asked me to help her find a job and was open to my suggestion of visiting the American Job Center to use their job search skills. She also had no difficulty networking with employed students to find open positions.

',5,'Julio had to overcome politics in Arizona as the rules for undocumented students changed while he was in high school.  At first these students could get in-state tuition and were eligible for scholarships by being in the Top 5% of their class.  Julio took four honor classes and retook freshmen classes to raise his GPA to make the Top 5% but then the rules changed.  He went from needing $1,000 to $17,000 to attend ASU.  He wrote to a local activist and was chosen to receive a Dream Act Fund scholarship.  Still he did not have the finances for housing, so he rode his bike 30 miles one way at 3AM to make 5:30AM cross country practice.  The following year he transferred to Grand Canyon University, which allowed him to live on campus.  He managed to attend four years of college for $2,000 in the state of Arizona as an undocumented student.  I would say he had to problem solve quite a bit to achieve his Bachelor Degree.',5,'As Julio\'s track and cross country coach he has had patience to work hard in achieving his goals.  Success does not come overnight in these sports.  Julio also had physical injuries that he had to endure and find a balance of trying to heal but still working out enough to keep in shape to compete at the highest level.  I also mentioned in the previous question that Julio had no transportation/housing for college so he rode his bike 30 miles to attend.  That is a big obstacle he had to overcome.',5,'Julio has returned to my classroom to speak with the freshmen students every year since he graduated high school.  He also comes back to help out the new coach with his cross country and track teams.  I switched schools for coaching twice and Julio has come to both schools to mentor my runners even though it is not his alma mater.  In addition Julio was the captain of our teams and for wrestling.  So he was mentoring even while in high school.  He helped a great deal with a younger runner who went on to be a state champion.',4,'I\'m not sure on this question.  I know Julio is very involved in a few previously mentioned groups.  I am sure he has gained an understanding of those organizations.  He and I have discussed issues on many occasions as I worry about his safety.  I also believe that the way in which an organization protests is important.  The first protest in Arizona for example had people carrying Mexican flags.  So I have talked to many people about this issue from many states and I give Julio feedback.  We talk about strategy in giving the message, not the message itself.  So if the above is what the question is asking for Julio is strong in this area.',4,'This one is difficult to judge as I have known Julio for 10 years since he was 14.  Back then he was very stubborn and would not ask for help.  That may be more typical as any 14 year old, but Julio could have a chip on his shoulder.  Since then he has softened.  He has asked for help with his schooling as I mentioned previously.  He asks me for help on occasion.  An example would be when he was thinking of transferring to Grand Canyon from ASU.  Naturally, that decision was difficult for him at age 19.  We discussed it for an hour or so and then I referred him to talk to his parents and coaches.  When he was honored at our school for the Sports Hall of Fame, his old ASU coach came to the ceremony.  This occurred a few years after he switched schools, so he maintained a good relationship with that coach by asking for his help in the decision making process.  I know Julio was very appreciative of the coach coming to witness his being honored.  It meant a lot to him.','I think Julio\'s family.  His oldest brother was deported many years ago and Julio\'s parents (great people) miss him a great deal.  Julio and his younger brother were able to see his oldest brother at the boarder after getting their temporary papers.  Unfortunately his parents could not go.  Going from Arizona to Washington DC would separate him from his family so to me this would be his greatest challenge.  Perhaps he could be awarded the time and money to visit on a quarterly basis.','Make sure he doesn\'t get arrested in the process of fighting for justice.  That is my concern because he would do so in a heartbeat.  I believe the process should encourage empathy by trying to put a \'face\' to the problem.  For example the picture Julio took at the boarder with his brother shows the separation.  Even some of the right-winged morons in Arizona would have to be sympathetic to that picture.  Good luck to you all, Julio will be an excellent candidate.  This is his passion.  He struggled mightily between working full-time for the cause and working for Target.

Since then I\'ve had the privilege of brainstorming and proactively working with Jeff in solving these problems in the context of Detroit. Whether the issue is transportation or economic justice I\'ve found myself attending innumerous meetings throughout the City where I\'ve always found an inquisitive young man sitting front row asking questions and afterward seeking out various political, non-profit and other activist leaders in pursuit of discussing the not only their next steps, but those which he\'d quickly derived from their presentation and his existing knowledge in order to pragmatically address the situation at hand.

One of the most positive attributes he possesses is his ability to retain and apply new information. Whether through empirical evidence (in visiting other cities throughout the country to revisit old colleagues and/or gaining a deeper understanding of how particular situations were addressed in other states) or through simply reviewing academic journals; Mr. Whitelow has an uncanny ability to seek out all information related to a particular topic and in doing so is able to present a multitude of scenarios by which to best address the issues. While working with a local non profit I witnessed firsthand Jeff\'s ability to identify untapped job opportunities for local residents. By focusing on utilizing a local hospitals supply chain gap, to provide substantive job opportunities for the surrounding local community, Jeff\'s actions helped facilitate more subcontracting opportunities for local residents with the hospital, in order to address the 37.2% unemployment in the area. Mr. Whitelow truly thinks outside of the box in addressing situations. ',5,'Throughout my time working with Mr. Whitelow he has always acted from realm of compassion for teaching others, as opposed to belittling he seeks to educate. Despite the many difficulties we both faced in working with a local hospital and community group on a Community Benefits Agreement (CBA), Jeff never gave up or backed down from what he believed would be in the best interest of the community during this now 2 year period. ',5,'Jeff has been a mentor to many community leaders, Urban Planning graduate and high schools students in Detroit who\'ve not had the opportunity to travel around the country and see best practices in play. He brings a very unique and genuine perspective which gives him the ability to gain the respect of all he encounters.

Jeff is  very respectful while critically evaluating an individual or organization, which serves to not only stifle the audiences feeling of inferiority but facilitates a deeper appreciation of the knowledge and expertise he possesses. Essentially Jeff will make you rethink your \"perfect\" plan while offering solutions and/or advice on how to make it more effective.',4,'Jeff has no qualms in empowering others to provide answers or assistance when needed.

I got to know Deveney when she was a Fall 2013 Running Start Star Fellow.  Running Start is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that encourages young women to get involved in politics and run for office.  The extremely competitive Star Fellowship program brings seven college-aged women to Washington, DC each semester to intern for a female Member of Congress each Monday through Thursday and to learn from high level political professionals and mentors each Friday in Running Start\'s office.  I am the Programs & Outreach Director at Running Start and have the opportunity to help select our Star Fellows and spend a large portion of each Friday with them.  I get to know each of the Star Fellows extremely well and love seeing their growth and development throughout the semester.  As a result of the Star Fellowship, I know Deveney on a personal and professional level and give her my highest possible recommendation.  She would be a wonderful addition to Code for Progress and I hope the examples below help give you an idea of the tremendous woman that Deveney is.\r\n\r\nDeveney\'s involvement in Running Start through the Star Fellowship speaks to her commitment to gender equality.  The entire focus of Running Start is political parody and Star Fellows learn directly from female Members of Congress about how they got where they are and what gender-related obstacles they faced on the way.  In addition, Star Fellows make a commitment to serve as Ambassadors of Running Start and go back to their communities to share the message that we need more women in politics.\r\n\r\nDeveney also has been involved with the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation (CBCF).  Deveney\'s former boss at the CBCF, who serves on Running Start\'s Board of Directors, has spoken very highly of Deveney to me as a result of Deveney\'s performance at the CBCF.  A woman of color, Deveney has shown an interest issues of race and a commitment to racial equality.\r\n\r\nDeveney has also shown an interest in economic justice through her work with the Memphis Urban League and Georgia STAND UP.\r\n\r\nDeveney\'s experiences show a strong commitment to gender, racial, and economic justice.',5,'One of the most interesting aspects of placing Star Fellows in Hill internships is seeing extremely accomplished and well-educated young women struggle to complete frustrating and mundane assignments.  During Deveney\'s internship, she was the only full-time intern in Congresswoman Terri Sewell\'s office.  I know that Deveney took on tasks ranging from answering the phones to completing research for hearings to staffing the Congresswoman at events with enthusiasm and excitement.  Her supervisor proactively contacted me to report that Deveney was the type of intern every congressional office dreams of because of her willingness to take on and complete any task.  Sometimes, Hill staffers and interns have to come up with creative solutions to get things done in a limited amount of time or on a limited budget, and I am confident that Deveney\'s creativity in solving a myriad of small problems that arose during her various tasks is what made her so valuable to that office.  At the end of the internship, Congresswoman Sewell took Devney to lunch and on a private tour of the cloakroom.  I can\'t imagine that the Congresswoman would have taken the time to do so if Deveney hadn\'t been absolutely exemplary in every way during her internship.',5,'Deveney has faced tremendous personal obstacles, which she has handled with unbelievable patience and grace.  For instance, one of Deveney\'s legs is amputated just below the knee.  If I was an amputee, I would probably mention it in every application I filled out because it would be such an important and defining struggle in my life.  However, Deveney never mentioned that she was an amputee until after she was accepted as a Running Start Star Fellow and we asked about her housing needs.  At one point during the Star Fellowship, Deveney has some fluid build up in the knee of her amputated leg.  She had to go to the Emergency Room to get the fluid drained and to make sure that the knee joint was not infected.  Deveney called me to let me know that she had to miss a day of her internship on the Hill because of the fluid build up, but never asked me to come be with her at the hospital.  I went to keep her company anyways.  I was with Deveney one-on-one at the hospital that night for about eight hours.  She was incredibly tough and upbeat, even though I knew she was in a lot of pain and was frustrated with the situation.  That night, Deveney told me that the amputation was the result of medical malpractice following a routine surgery.  I so much enjoyed the time I got to spend with Deveney in the Emergency Room, which is a testament to her unbreakable spirit since Emergency Rooms are not generally enjoyable.  I really admire Deveney\'s tenacity and refusal to let an unfortunate situation define her or hold her back in anyway.  As frustrated as she was, Deveney didn\'t cry that night, but as soon as I dropped her off I broke down and sobbed the whole way home.  ',5,'At the end of the Fall 2013 Star Fellowship, Running Start surveyed its Star Fellows to ask what they liked about the Star Fellowship and what could be improved upon.  Several of the Star Fellows said that they would have liked to have had a young woman mentor who was a Star Fellow alumna.  I followed up on the survey and spoke with the Star Fellows about creating a formal mentoring program, in which they would serve as mentors to the next group of Star Fellows, and they were all very enthusiastic.  So I paired up our current and future Star Fellows into mentoring pairs.  As you might imagine, some of the most vocal advocates of the mentoring program failed to contact their assigned mentees immediately and needed several reminders.  But Deveney immediately contacted the young woman, Antonia, whom she was assigned.  I asked Antonia recently about Deveney\'s mentorship and Antonia told me that Deveney has reached out to her several times through different channels to connect, even though Antonia hasn\'t needed as much guidance as she thought she might and hasn\'t even been fully responsive to Deveney.  This is a perfect example of how Deveney gets things done.  She\'s committed to teaching and mentoring others in a quiet and personal way, even if she has to approach the mentee several times.',5,'During the first week of the Star Fellowship, Star Fellows are assigned to complete an academic reading about women in politics.  I am embarrassed to admit that during the Fall 2013 Star Fellowship, six of the seven Star Fellows claimed they did not do the reading because they were unable to access it.  I emailed the reading to each Star Fellow and placed in a Dropbox folder that they were given access to.  Deveney was the one Star Fellow who actually did the reading.  I was impressed with Deveney because as we discussed the reading it was clear she had carefully read the assignment, pondered it, and had made several interesting connections to other things she had studied and read.  Star Fellows are not quizzed on the readings and there is no mechanism to enforce that they have in fact read.  I can therefore understand Star Fellows who are tempted to skim the readings and/or pretend that they cannot not access them.  I will forever be impressed by Deveney\'s performance during our first meeting because she had done the reading, had it pulled up on her iPad for reference, and could discuss it in depth and relate it to other material.  To me, that demonstrates a habit of curiosity that goes beyond curiosity to impress a teacher or a interviewer. ',5,'Even though Deveney is extremely independent, she was humble enough to ask for my help on several occasions after we spent time together in the Emergency Room.  As someone who is often too proud to ask for help myself, I admired Deveney\'s willingness to open up to me and ask for me help when it was needed.  I believe that Deveney is sophisticated enough to ask those who she trusts for help when she needs it and is careful not to impose by over-asking.','I believe that the biggest challenge Deveney faces is one that I have already mentioned, her amputation.

Feeling that his professor’s lectures were misinforming students, Fareed spend a weekend reading articles about Islamic Art and planning a creative way to approach the professor about his misunderstandings. After the following week’s lecture, Fareed spoke to the professor and politely explained how the textbook was Eurocentric. Afterwards the professor gave Fareed the opportunity to explain common misconceptions about Islamic Art to the other student and proceeded to supplement his lectures with examples of non-european art throughout the year.

Unfortunately, Fareed’s problem has not been resolved. Yet, he continues to look for solutions despite the many obstacles in his way. ',4,'Fareed loves to engage with people. I\'ve noticed that whenever he learns something new, he approaches other and opens discussions.

Throughout the course of developing the lesson plans and the overall program structure, Gabrielle was insistent on assuring that the lessons were appealing and engaging for females as well. Having seen that females were/are under-represented in the STEM fields, Gabrielle made sure we did not allow our lessons to leave the female students less engaged that their male counterparts.  She did this by assisting with course material selection to make sure that each was gender neutral or  made sure that the instructors had some tips/tricks for gaining engagement from all students in their groups. This is just one example of Gabrielle\'s commitment to trying to improve gender equality and attempt to reverse some of the traditional gender role in science and technology.',4,'While developing plans to re-launch the Elementary Outreach program we started in high school, one of the major obstacles we have faced is where to find funding.  Initially the concepts we had for funding were limited to applying for education based grants and appealing to the school district to support the program financially.  Seeing that these sources would likely not be enough, Gabrielle came up with new ideas for additional options for funding.  A few of those options were: \r\n1. Partially adopting common core standards in order to open up new avenues to secure grants and other funding targeted towards programs built around common core standards.\r\n2. Developing a community outreach portion to the program that would place high school participants in internships/jobs that with local companies to incentivize partnering with our program.  This allowed the program to be more appealing to local companies and provides students with worthwhile job experience.\r\n\r\nThough these ideas are still in development, they have opened our eyes to entirely new approaches to finding funding and added amazing new benefits for students who participate in the program.',5,'The Elementary Outreach program has been a side project for Gabrielle and I for years. Despite having our first attempt slowly die out while we were away at university, Gabrielle has consistently pushed to keep making progress towards seeing this program come back to life in some form.  While she has not been able to focus all of her attention to this endeavor, I can say that it has only been able to progress as far as it has due to her willingness to push despite everything else going on.

Brother-sister relationships being what they are, when he needed help with school, despite her best efforts to help him on her own, she found she needed help getting through to him.  This is when she reached out to a friend from her class to help tutor her brother in math. By being willing to admit that she couldn\'t get through to her brother efficiently, she was able to help him get into a situation that allowed him to develop better and help him catch up in math.','She has been across the country from her family for the past six years.

This is equally evident in both his personal and professional endeavors.  For the six years I have known Daniel, he has consistently kept a diverse group of friends.  He is quick to engage new interactions with whomever he meets, regardless of origin or creed.  Although this may seem a trivial matter to discuss in a recommendation, I truly believe it lends credence to the notion that Daniel genuinely views everyone in the same optimistic light.  Professionally, Daniel has consistently sought educational and career opportunities that would allow him to advocate for people.  His educational background focused mainly on political science.  He pursued this path with an interest in learning the processes and systems in place to represent American citizens\' interests.  In my frequent discussions with Daniel regarding his education, it was clear that his passion for equitable representation of the traditionally disenfranchised drove him through the academic rigor.  To further bolster his experience in learning to represent the concerns of people, he sought positions in the offices of congress men and women, where he listened to the concerns of constituents representing a diverse demographic spectrum.  ',5,'One particular incident comes to mind which lends considerable insight into this facet of Daniel\'s character.  Daniel and I were roommates during our freshman year in undergraduate education.  Sometime near finals, I recall Daniel having a group of people over to work on a group project.  Daniel was quite the host, ordering pizza and making the atmosphere far less onerous than your traditional frantic group project environment.  Prior to the meeting, several members of the group had been neglecting their work.  Rather than letting the project fail, or doing all the work himself, Daniel brought the group together and fostered a collective energy to encourage everyone to get work done.  Daniel seemed to see through the barriers, and was able to arbitrate a solution in which everyone benefited.      ',5,'I would rate this as Daniel\'s highest virtue.  Early in his education, Daniel realized that his passion lied in serving others.  He chose political science with a keen awareness of the high amount of commitment and rigor one must commit to be successful in the field.  After his Undergraduate he immediately began his Masters, which he completed in a year and a half.  Since completing his Master\'s, Daniel has tirelessly sought opportunities which would further him on his path.  With a patience I have yet to see matched in any of my peers, Daniel has successfully completed several internships, receiving minimal to no compensation for his hard efforts.  Daniel has faced significant financial constraints during this time, particularly while working at his internship in Washington DC.  He has gotten by on very slim monetary reserves, and his spirits have never dampened.    ',5,'During our undergraduate education, Daniel tutored several individuals free of charge.  He seemed to take it as incumbent onto himself to help his class mated who were struggling.  I recall one particular occasion, in which he was tutoring a student I judged to be a lost cause.  It was late in the evening.  Myself and a mutual friend of Daniel and I\'s had long since abandoned the ambition of completing any school work for the evening, and were plating video games.  Daniel was slowly going over coursework with a classmate of his, whom seemed more interested in Daniel doing his work than in learning.  I recall being frustrated for Daniel, wondering why he bothered helping this disinterested kid.  After Daniel finished the tutoring session, I asked him why he would bother with someone who seemed to care so little.  Daniel answered that he believed his friend had a lot of potential, and that he just needed some prodding in the right direction.  I must admit that the implications of Daniel\'s sincerity escaped me at the time.  Yet, in retrospect, incidents such as these bore testament to the quality of Daniel\'s character, and his commitment to helping others reach their potential.  ',5,'I would describe Daniel as quite the techie.  I have always been impressed with his technical literacy, and interest in how technology works.  As evidence to these attributes, Daniel built his own high powered PC. I recall a period of time in which most of my regular phone conversations with Daniel were preoccupied with computer parts that Daniel was researching.  He\'d talk ad nauseum about the merits of different computer components.  He read extensively about how to choose and assemble computer components, and was eventually successful in building a computer.',5,'By and large, most of Daniel\'s education seemed to come easily to him.  I do, however, recall him taking a particularly difficult chemistry course which seemed to challenge him.  I suspect this course was Daniel\'s first truly challenging academic endeavor.  For many of my well learned peers, academic performance is the source of some pride; pride is damaged by asking for help.  This was a non-issue for Daniel.  He recognized he needed help, and unhesitatingly sought regular assistance from the professor.  With perseverance and a willingness to ask for help, Daniel passed the course.','Daniel has a habit of focusing intensely to any particular task he takes on.  This can be a double edged sword.  While it allows him to do quality work, it may give him some trouble in working with the big picture.  ','Daniel is a driven individual who loves challenges.  Keep him challenged, and he will thrive!  ',1,NULL),(1045,987,972,5,'I first met Carlos in 2008 through the immigrant youth group IDEAS at UCLA, a nationally wide known organization that supports and advocates for undocumented youth. As Co-chair of the organization at the time, I saw Carlos when he first entered UCLA as an undocumented student and became involved in the immigrant youth movement through IDEAS. His willingness to get involved and help others, as well as his curiosity to learn from everyone around him immediately caught my attention. \r\n\r\nI witnessed Carlos\' passion and commitment to social justice grow through his immigrant identity at first; but it soon became obvious he understood we are part of one struggle, one community. He has been an ardent advocate for building community consciousness around our various identities and struggles including fighting for LGBTQ, racial, and economic justice. What strikes me most about Carlos, is that he not only demonstrates his love for community and understanding of collective struggle through his words, but he models it through his actions. His devotion to community service is astounding. It is evident in his love for mentoring youth, his thirst to quench his endless curiosity with others, and his consistent enthusiasm to combine the sciences with social justice learning. ',5,'Carlos was a Freedom School teacher in the first Freedom School in the country under the Children\'s Defense Fund. We led this program in the summer of 2013 to nurture youth empowerment by exploring immigrant identity and teaching a curriculum centered around community organizing. As co-director of this pilot 6-week program, I knew we needed the best team possible to execute something that had never been done before, and to ensure our inner city, low-income high school youth learned knowledge they could use to grow their power and confidence. Carlos was a natural choice when it came to thinking about who could effectively communicate with youth, and not only teach them but learn with them. \r\n\r\nThe problem we meant to address through this program was the disempowerment of immigrant youth in high schools and their lack of confidence in reaching higher education. This problem does not have an easy fix, but Carlos\' creativity and commitment to youth empowerment helped us overcome the many obstacles we faced on a daily basis. When we found ourselves not including enough focus on the sciences, Carlos pointed this out in a constructive manner and proactively volunteered himself to lead a science fair the youth could learn from. This was the best science fair I ever attended, and most importantly, the youth gained so much knowledge and had a great time interacting with the various science stations Carlos organized. This is just one example of the invaluable perspective and leadership Carlos brings to any team he is a part of.',5,'Working with youth takes significant amount of patience. Additionally, teaching science and math to youth often requires creativity and patience, which Carlos has definitely nourished over years of experience (Carlos also graduated from UCLA with a mathematics degree last year). One example that comes to mind is when one of the youth in Carlos\' class communicated he had feelings for Carlos during the Freedom School program. Carlos handled the situation with intention, understanding, and effective communication. He reached out to me as co-director to let me know this happened, and asked for help in handling the situation. At no point did he react negatively to the student or generate any tension in his classroom or in the program. Rather, he reached out for support from other staff and was able to continue to be an effective mentor for the student while at the same time clearly communicating healthy boundaries. This was a clear example of Carlos\' leadership and teaching abilities. Throughout the experience, I was proud and grateful to have Carlos on our team.',5,'While at UCLA, Carlos mentored incoming undocumented youth. He was always eager to pass forward the knowledge he gained from those before and around him. This is part of the beauty of his curiosity and thirst for knowledge--he not only seeks to learn from others, he has a passion for teaching and mentoring others so they may utilize that knowledge to empower themselves and use that knowledge with purpose. \r\n\r\nIn addition to leading countless undocumented student workshops and tutoring math and science (as a job to help pay for college and voluntarily to his peers at UCLA, myself included), I saw Carlos cultivate his love for mentoring others every chance he could. He welcomed incoming undocumented students to IDEAS and showed them the resources we could access. and the resources we could fight to have access to. Carlos understands the responsibility of mentorship and how critical it is to teach each other our history and how we have progressed through struggle and advocacy to show how we can build on the gains our ancestors and peers have won. \r\n\r\nCarlos also has a deep understanding of collective learning and popular education. This is what made him such an impactful teacher for our Freedom scholars last summer, and what makes him such a powerful leader in our movement.',5,'As I mentioned, Carlos\' curiosity is one of his most striking qualities. I can count on Carlos to ask questions, clarify issues to benefit the learning of the entire group, and critically think about how and why things are the way they are. Whether it\'s a math problem, a personal issue one of our students is struggling with, or the effectiveness of a program, Carlos consistently offers a critical perspective which is always provided in a helpful manner. If IDEAS meetings felt ineffective, Carlos would analyze the way meetings were run and attempt to shift the structure or flow in a way that encouraged a more engaged membership. This kind of support also came through in our Freedom school summer program time and time again, as this was a pilot program and Carlos played a key role in ensuring the most effective experience for our youth.',5,'Carlos\' curiosity and passion for mentoring and teaching allows him to see the importance of asking for help, as well as providing help to others. However, Carlos will analyze a problem and actively listen to what is shared before asking questions. This is helpful to foster optimal learning, especially in group settings. Moreover, Carlos is not afraid to ask for help. Rather, he seems to see it as a strength, and I see this as a strong quality in him. It is important to practice what you preach, and Carlos demonstrates his curiosity and passion for knowledge openly and proudly. This is particularly important for him to do as a Latino male, who many look up to as a teacher, mentor, and leader.','Carlos has advanced his public speaking significantly since I began working with him in college, but I think this is one area he can continue to improve upon with support and practice.

As an undocumented immigrant student he has developed a nuanced understanding of the ways in which various forms of social inequality (race, class, gender, sexuality, immigration status) reinforce one another to maintain social inequalities. To address this, he has consistently engaged in a number of research, teaching, and community engagement opportunities where he used education as a tool for racial, economic, immigration status, and gender justice. He has worked primarily to support the educational advancement of low-income Latinas/os while paying special attention to the needs of undocumented students who are legally marginalized within U.S. society and Latino men who are often socially marginalized (e.g. criminalized) within U.S. society.\r\n\r\nHe has been actively involved in IDEAS at UCLA (an undocumented student organization) for his entire UCLA career and has consistently used this space to fight for the rights of immigrants, while also trying to ensure that this space is inclusive across race, gender, and sexuality. For example, out of his commitment to racial equality within the undocumented community, he elected to volunteer to help me with a project I was developing on the experiences of non-Latina/o undocumented students, a group that most do not discuss because undocumented migration has been constructed as a Latina/o issue. However, 25% of undocumented immigrants are not Latina/o and we know very little about how their race is shaping their experiences, nor how to best support them. Having worked with a number of non-Latina/o undocumented students, Carlos was attune to the need to raise awareness about this population and pushed me to use my research findings to develop a policy brief on best-practices for supporting non-Latina/o undocumented students. Due to his commitment to this project, he is lead author on the report that we are currently writing. \r\n',5,'I believe that Carlos’ experience as an undocumented student in higher education has made him very creative in his problem solving. As an undocumented student at UCLA, he has to pay tuition (approximately $12,000) without the help of financial aid and so was working multiple side jobs while still taking a full load of classes. Having interacted with a number of UCLA undocumented students, I can say that most of them have some sort of external financial support (i.e. substantial external scholarships, family help) which has helped them pay for school and their living expenses. Carlos, however, did not have this help and was able to use his problem solving skills to make ends meet. For example, he scanned book reserves or found ways to borrow course books, found campus offices who could provide him with free food on campus, and found other organizations who provided him with other free resources. As a member of IDEAS he then helped work to institutionalize and advertise many of these resources so that they would be available to other undocumented students. It is through this work that he helped build a partnership with a local religious organization which now serves daily free hot meals to students so that students are no longer starving themselves to pay for school or eating unhealthy, cheap food.\r\n\r\nThis creative problem solving is been an asset as we have been developing the policy report on how to best support non-Latina/o students. Carlos’ experience working to build creative partnerships has led him to immediately suggest many similar policy recommendations that I would have taken me much longer to develop on my own. He definitely thinks outside of the box and outside of traditional channels when developing recommendations.\r\n\r\n',5,'Working as my research assistant has shown me the Carlos is very patient. I have had a number of students volunteer to work with me and they often do not last long because of their impatience with the often-slow nature of research. However, Carlos has been diligently working with me for approximately two years now, significantly longer than any of my previous assistants. Much of his early work transcribing my interviews word-for-word and reading through transcripts to label them with a large number of themes can be very tedious and frustrating work – it is hard to understand the recordings of people done in loud places and trying to interpret someone’s words to figure out which theme to label something can be very difficult. However, Carlos is extremely patient at working through these obstacles – listening or reading through things multiple times until he is sure he has gotten it right. For many (including myself) this can make you want to tear your hair out, but Carlos does it with such grace and chooses to think about it as an opportunity to understand someone’s story better, rather than as bothersome.',5,'Carlos past research, teach, and community engagement have largely focused on teaching and mentoring others. He has made a number of short presentations to encourage and provide information to younger students about pursuing an education. Further, he has been a tutor, mentor, and instructor with various organizations including Freedom School, California Science Center, various middle schools, and the Salvadoran Leadership and Educational Fund. Finally, over the past two years, Carlos and I have repeatedly discussed his intention to apply for (and hopefully enroll in) the UCLA urban schooling program to get his Masters and teaching credential. Together all of these things show his commitment to teaching and mentoring as part of his career path.\r\n\r\nWithin the context of my research project, Carlos was quick to mentor a second Research Assistant who joined the project in the past few months without my asking him to. He helped the other RA understand the interview guide and identify places where interviews can get off track. Further, the other RA was also an undocumented student but she did not want to share her undocumented status with others during the interview; Carlos helped her brainstorm about ways to talk about or not talk about her status with the interviewees. While she had adamantly resisted the idea of sharing her status with the interviewees during our meeting, Carlos’ mentorship, willingness to share his own experiences, and willingness to help her think through her status led her to ultimately begin sharing her status with interviewees and feel more comfortable about talking about her status in general.\r\n',5,'Conducting research inherently requires curiosity and interest in explaining a phenomenon. In the case of my research, Carlos was so curious about the potential answers to how to better support non-Latina/o undocumented that he choose to volunteer to help with the project without pay. While this may not seem like a big deal to volunteer, I believe it demonstrates commitment to explaining this phenomenon because it requires Carlos to sacrifice time that he could be using to do other things, including earning much needed money. He is extremely dedicated to figuring out all the pieces to explain the non-Latina/o experience and then using that information to achieve social justice through policy recommendations.',5,'Carlos is always willing to ask for help and next directions. Most of the research assistant work he does is independent but he recognizes when he needs help and/or guidance. Further, he can often determine whether this help would be best provided in a face-to-face meeting, on the phone, or via email/text. As a supervisor, this is one of most unique qualities in asking for help because when he does ask for help, I am confident that he actually needs help (ie. Is not being lazy – which is the case for many of my students) and that the conversation will be productive. Based on our conversations, I believe that he was similarly willing to ask for help on his other research, teaching, and community projects.','Carlos has faced many challenges in his life, but the one that has most shaped him is his status as an undocumented immigrant.  This has been a reason that he has been denied many opportunities to pursue his dreams of being a teacher and working for social justice (e.g. formal internships, support programs) because he was unable to work legally (this has now changed that he has a work permit) or because these were federally funded programs. I think that this experience has made Carlos stronger and more aware of social inequalities but it also means that he has been blocked from participating in many of the same things as his citizen peers. I believe that simply admitting him to your program would be a big step in making sure that he feelings like a member of a community. Once in the program making sure that there is an openness to discuss undocumented immigrant issues and recognize the limitations that undocumented status may create. For example, talking about traveling abroad is a way to exclude undocumented immigrants and prevent them from feeling like community members. Being aware of conversations that could unintentionally exclude them would be helpful. ','I think one of the things Carlos could work on is time-management and developing reachable deadlines. For example, when coding interviews he can take longer than expected because he gets wrapped up in reflecting on the story. While this is as a positive, it can prevent him from meeting his deadlines at times. Further, he tends to be too ambitious when setting his own deadlines. Surrounded by academics who often set their own schedules, I believe this is a fairly common weakness. As a result, Carlos and I have been working on how to manage and track your time and how to set attainable deadlines. He has gotten better at this but could still use support in developing this skill. It could be useful if there was someone who is checking in with him on a regular basis in order to set and adjust deadlines and provide feedback and a space to bounce ideas off of.

And Tara was instrumental in that.  Tara is a woman who brings considerable patience to pretty much everything.  ',5,'As noted above, Tara started and managed Long Distance Voter\'s intern program. She recruited, trained and supervised our interns for the duration of their engagement, and took considerable pleasure in the role. \r\n\r\nTara also enjoys being mentored, and I believe this quality is essential for one who wishes to assume the roles for others.  I know this because I was her professional mentor at the CCRB.  She was a quick study, eager to learn, pleasant to work with and dedicated to improvement.  She brings this excitement for new knowledge with her when she mentors others; this passion for both learning and teaching makes her an ideal candidate for any mentorship role.

A new investigator who doesn\'t ask for help will fail at being an investigator. Many new investigators believe that they\'ll be great simply because they\'ve always been great at school. Tara was smart enough to recognize how different the CCRB was from university and actually ask for help when needed.  She went on to be a great investigator (and then a great member of the mediation team).','I haven\'t seen Tara struggle often, but I do recognize that coding will be entirely new to her, and will likely be difficult at first.

The entire process took a little over one year – from completing the house search to a stable, committed group of housemates.',5,'Kevin is an active participant in The Bike House, a community-based bicycle repair coop in the Petworth neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The coop provides free bike maintenance and education, and in general acts as a free space for people learning how to repair and service their bikes. As part of the coop, Kevin has acted as a mentor for others trying to learn more about the mechanics of bike repair. In addition, he joined the coop in doing workshops in high poverty neighborhoods in Washington D.C. as well as in McPherson Square during the Occupy protests. In these interactions, Kevin also explicitly connects these activities to larger issues of transportation justice. He is interested in disparities in funding levels across modes of transportation, unequal access to existing transportation infrastructure that is predicted by socioeconomic factors, and the role that transportation plays in gentrification. ',5,'Kevin excels at both physical mechanics – he has built his own bicycle and computer, and currently works as a bike mechanic in a Washington D.C. bike shop – and at deconstructing issues that focus on economic and social justice. He has developed a systematic way to catalog his ideas and is adept at positioning himself in ways where his voice can have an impact. For example, he became a volunteer editor at a major Washington D.C. urban planning blog (where I contributed photos) and then used the position to challenge the blog to take a more progressive stance on its political endorsements. Recently, in his anti-austerity advocacy work, he has also used public records to dig into the intertwined funding and governance of organizations that have called for cuts to the social safety net.',4,'Kevin seeks input and help from people to generate ideas and aid in their execution. This was apparent during the process of forming an intentional community in Washington D.C. Kevin and I had a shared idea of what the community should be but necessarily had to incorporate the help and perspective of the people who joined us. Our idea of the type of community we should have evolved and improved from the input of others, and the overall process was one where the quality of our community depended on our shared willingness to ask for and accept help in its formation. However, Kevin is also a very independent person; he is self-motivated and respects the time and input of others when he does ask for help. ','Kevin is a first generation college graduate who graduated with a very high amount of student debt – more than twice that of the median student. He attended an expensive liberal arts college is aware of how his financial situation has put him at a disadvantage when compared with many of his peers. In addition, he is aware of how his debt burden impacted his decisions after college by introducing significant stress and risk-aversion at a critical time in his career development. Kevin has been challenged by this particular economic disadvantage: its continued negative effects on his ability to get ahead financially as well as the curtailment of his career opportunities.','Kevin builds trust with colleagues and friends through shared projects and genuine acts of support. He works hard, takes ownership of his work, and respects others who do the same. He enjoys people who are earnest and are able to articulate their commitment to progressive ideals. He does best in small groups where there is a shared commitment to a goal that aligns with his ideals. In those situations he will generate and communicate terrific plans, and has an innate command for organizing people toward their completion.',1,NULL),(1071,1015,992,5,'Kevin works with all of us at Capitol Hill Bikes.

As a mechanic he deals with many different people with many different needs.  He is great at taking initiative with customers to make sure that we can fix whatever problem they have based on their budget.  One example is this one customer that loves Kevin.  She came in for a quick fix but her bike was not functional.  We had some bikes that had been abandoned and he made sure to find one that would work within her budget.  Now she comes in at least once a week specially asking for Kevin.   ',5,'It is rare that Bicycle Mechanics are good with people.  Kevin is one of those people.  As I mentioned that he works with people day in and day out being patience with customers who may know what is going on with their bike, but in reality doesn\'t fully understand.  Kevin walks customers through all the issues and makes it easy for them to understand while giving them options to decide what would work with their budget.  ',4,'Before Kevin came on to Capitol Hill Bikes he did some work as part of the Bike House Co-op in D.C..  The objective is to help people learn how  fix their own bikes.  A great quality of Kevin is his ability to step back and be objective of a situation in a non personal way.

This is the same for any tech issues at the shop, which he is our go to guy to fix and tech issues.

Now in her twenties, I am amazed at her ability to competently and diligently work with others towards solutions on complicated problems -- like planning a coordinated response to the Trayvon Martin verdict with a group of Black Organizers, each used to running their own events, forced to collaborate together, non-hierarchically. ',5,'I\'m currently working on a project in Chicago mobilizing 15 youth who are involved in the foster care system. Originally, we had a team of five adult mentors. Angie was one of the first to sign up to be a co-facilitator and run workshops with the youth. When the main co-facilitator backed out, Angie jumped at the opportunity to work with me in teaching young people barely younger than herself. She is an expert facilitator and presenter, specifically in engaging traditionally difficult-to-reach populations, like teenagers, especially those with non-traditional educational backgrounds, or who have dropped out of school. Her heart is as strong as her mind in this aspect, and she uses both in her mentorship work. ',5,'Angie is one of the young people that makes you incredible happy to be an organizer, and also one of the one\'s that makes your job incredibly complicated (in the best of ways). I recall sitting in meeting with Angie, explaining a concept as a preface for our next action/event. What was planned as a 15 minute planning meeting became a conversation over an hour, as we delved deeper into the concept behind our work (in this case, we were running a campaign around the closing of a Juvenile Detention Facility with a terrible record on human rights). As this story illustrates, Angie is not one to let a concept or idea pass without full investigation. She takes theories and ideas and breaks them down, fits them back together to understand how they work. She is both visual and analytic, and can break apart ideas to understand how they function in the world. She also excels at breaking big tasks, like a city-wide event, down into its composite parts. She knows how to build a large achievement through small pieces of collaborative work. ',5,'Angie is collaborative at heart. She knows that all big labors of love and change take the work of many towards a united goal. She is often there for others in large ways, and can also reach out to others when she is in need. An example of this would be when she joined the Illinois United for Marriage campaign as an organizer for the Southside of Chicago. Angie knew that to build a campaign, she would have to bring in her connections elsewhere, to ask for their help on a new endeavor. With little budget or organizational support, Angie reached out to organizations she had helped build or support in the past. She was open about the difficulties she was facing as the sole organizer running a phonebank on the Southside. She identified her needs and reached out to mentors and people involved in organizations on the Southside who could provide what she needed. They were able to help provide her space, people, or a time to speak to their own members about the organization. Angie made it happen, but first she had to know what she needed, and where to go for it. ','Angie is arduously working to complete a college degree and could use support in this area. She is a learner in so many non-traditional venues, any support or mentorship in terms of more traditional schooling might be helpful.','Angie in the last few years lost her mother, and is disconnected from the rest of her family. Being physically away from Chicago would definitely help her explore new communities and ideas. Building a family and community of support wherever she goes, with love and affirmation, could be great for her.',1,NULL),(1089,1034,674,5,'Angalique has over 5 years of experience initiating and collaborating on organizing campaigns around racial, gender, and economic justice (Center for Change, Gender Just, and ONE are but 3 examples that address multiple types of oppression). A great driving factor in her work has been the economic and racial oppression so endemic in Chicago. She has frequently used her experience working with diverse groups to enhance the work on a particular campaign -- for example, in working for Marriage Equality in Illinois, she brought her awareness of the unique issues of Chicago\'s Southside, predominantly Black and economically marginalized, and spoke passionately about how to best include Black and poor segments of Chicago in the organization\'s work. Through periods of schooling, full-time employment, and unemployment, Angalique has strongly exemplified an enduring commitment to the goals of justice in its many forms, volunteering and supporting events and organizations in many capacities. When paid positions are unavailable (as we all know non-profits can be unstable and the current climate doesn\'t help), Angalique finds ways to stay involved and engaged on the issues that matter to her and her communities. ',5,'In a variety of settings, Angalique has responded to problems with creativity, but also hustle. Hustle is creativity in action, and Angalique exemplifies it. Hustle is making events happen with no budget, no time, and no transportation. Hustle is anticipating problems, but also responding to them in real-time. As a field organizer for the Southside of Chicago during the push for Marriage Equality in IL, Angalique was able to mobilize diverse coalitions of people to volunteer by engaging stakeholders outside of the norm. She knew that the traditional model used in the more well known, economically stable, \"gay friendly\" neighborhoods would not adapt well. Instead, she sought out new groups of constituents. Her phone banking nights were filled with ardent church goers, Black lesbian couples, and queer students from various parts of the Southside. She didn\'t have PFLAG meetings to go to -- they didn\'t exist. She had to build her base by thinking -- and doing -- differently. She\'s also an aspiring clothing designer whose eye for patterns and placement is so precise and so \"new\"/avant!  ',5,'I have watched many a difficult discussion that could have resulted in confusion, derail, be brought back to its roots and essence by Angie, whittling it down to themes, bullet points, that help pull a group back on track. She takes down all input, then re-states the issue to the group in a more digestible form. In any given room, she\'s had to work with elders who talk over youth, youth who disrespect elders, assimilationists who shout down Black Power promoters. She manages to create an atmosphere for opinions to be heard, personal contexts to be respected, while attaining a group goal of understanding and moving forward. She is patient but definitive, able to find a point of consensus and keep to the clock at the same time. ',5,'In hundreds of workshops in just a few short years, Angalique\'s skills and interest in teaching others has shone brightly. Despite her relative youth, she has stepped into leadership roles naturally and with confidence. She engages in many projects but always in a highly invested capacity. Her specialty in many ways is pushing others to develop a critical analysis of the world around them, taking apart the structures and definitions we have become too comfortable with. For example, at the Assata Teach-In, which she co-facilitated with another leader/activist nearly twice her age, she was speaking to an audience with everyone from teenagers to octogenarians. She excels in working with groups, and has sought out the opportunity to build with groups of young people on many occasions. Recently, she has been working with two well known groups in Chicago to develop workshops and curriculum around the impact of Incarceration and the Foster System. Her experience in developing and leading curricula is, again, surprising because of her age, but belies her deep interest in this work. ',5,'There are many examples I could give about Angalique seeking the depths of critical theory, on a more academic and activist level, plumbing the depths of her own ideas, finding the weaknesses in the walls of her own, and others\', thoughts. She digs into articles and then breaks them down to their ideas, reforumlating and re-articulating what works, what doesn\'t work, where the macrostructures that surround us leave their mark on our every day lives. However, I\'d also like to give an example with a little more tangibility -- Angalique loves Legos. While she does play legos with my nephew, when by herself she takes a more studious and measured approach to building. Not simply legos -- other models as well, ones with working lights and electronic parts. It\'s a more physical version, I think, of what she does with critical theory. She puts together buildings, vehicles, worlds, from small pieces, creating structures that make sense. ',4,'Many people have provided crucial mentorship and guidance to Angalique throughout her development, and she is quick to acknowledge their energy and patience with her. Angalique is a young woman who has had to \"do for herself\" from a younger age than most, and has been empowered in leadership positions that many at her age are just now attaining. In light of this context, Angie has a \"Let\'s Do It\" mentality. She pushes herself and others to find solutions to group and individual problems. When she requires guidance, she has people to whom she can reach for help, and she does. ','Several years ago Angalique\'s mother passed away, and she has built a strong community of supporters, mentors, and friends around her. She does not have a large family-of-origin to lean back on, but does have a strong community of friends. Due in part to these circumstances, she has at times experienced housing instability (temporary house-less-ness).','The most critical piece I believe this project could provide would be to help provide skills to round out Angalique\'s existing solid base of technological and social media skills with more technical elements to help her spread her message and become one of many leaders in the next digital charge for change.

As a result, she created a website called checktheweather.net, which was interactive for the students and youth and allowed for others to read and share the information showing how the grassroots communities she worked with were being impacted by climate change.  It was a really good communications tool and I was very impressed by her creativity in setting it all up  in such a way that made it both interactive and informative.',5,'Kari is still working with the Energy Action Coalition though at times it has felt like the central staff and certain partners will never understand what environmental justice truly means and it has been tempting to simply walk away and focus on the work in her own community but Kari understands the necessity to try to engage at a deeper level within this coalition for the greater good of everyone involved.  There have been obstacles with the funding, obstacles with the level of understanding, obstacles of historical differences causing anxiety and confusion and more, but through it all Kari has exercised her patience in explaining over and over again how the grassroots communities differ from others and showing by example why it\'s important to all work together to create change for the greater good.  Even though it has been an uphill battle at times Kari\'s patience has paid off and the results are now showing that very different organizations can work together with a little bit of work in helping them gain and understanding and appreciation of each other.',5,'Kari has taught and mentored several students and youth from historically black colleges and universities since I\'ve known her.  She has engaged them in trainings on environmental justice, dismantling oppression, communications and public speaking, research and fact finding, working outside their comfort zone and along the way has been a great friend to the several students she\'s worked with.',5,'I\'m not sure if Kari likes to \"take things apart\" but I have seen her work hard to bring people from various backgrounds together and as such she has had to dig into the structure of other organizations to gain a better understanding of how they operate.

As a result there is now an Environmental Justice Fellowship program currently mentoring 9 students that identify as youth of color from frontline communities across the country that are working together in their fight around climate change and environmental injustices.   This program was made possible, in large part, by Kari having a vision but needing help to make it become a reality and her asking all of the right people for help is what ultimately made it possible.','The only thing that comes to mind, which shouldn\'t be counted against her, is that Kari has a new baby and as a new mom might be more tired than usual.','Just be flexible with her schedule if she has to go home unexpectedly for any reason and understand that being a new full time mom is an adjustment.',1,NULL),(1103,1049,673,5,'I first met Kari while we were both students at Howard University, working on a range of social justice issues including race, gender, and economic justice.

Her commitment was so valuable and real that I asked her to join Dreaming Out Loud --my organization\'s Board of Directors; she has served for four years. ',5,'Two of Kari\'s most inspiring characteristics are creativity and passion. I think that for her these two traits work together in solving problems because she is not deterred and finds creative, collaborative and fair solutions to problems.

',1,NULL),(1104,1050,673,5,'For the last seven years, Kari has worked at the intersection of race and the environment. She started out as a student leader with the Environmental Justice and Climate Change Initiative (EJCC) and then hired as their campaign director. EJCC works to organize communities of color that are often the most impacted by toxic waste facilities, power plants, and the affects of climate change (i.e. Hurricane Katrina & Sandy). Those are also the same communities that are economically oppressed. Working at these intersections has been the bulk of Kari\'s work. In her time, she has led countless trainings on the importance of such a lens, she has helped spearhead a network of young organizers of color to meet and strategize together, and has helped build online spaces to explore these issues in depth. ',4,'The first word that comes to mind when thinking of Kari is creative. I\'ve been in several meetings with her and with 20 more of our colleagues and inevitably the group will hit a \"road block.\" Whether it is the creative analogies she comes up with to describe where we are at and where we need to go, or the suggested exercises to refocus us -- Kari often has something up her sleeve that re-frames our struggle and helps us view the situation in a fresh way.   ',4,'Over the last seven years, Kari has encountered many obstacles through her work on  environmental justice-- which at its core takes into account systems of oppression, while working on environmental issues. The work on environmental justice is so critical and yet it is the least funded sector working for social change. That alone is enough to provide mountains of obstacles, but Kari has also done this work along side organizations in the environmental movement, which historically does not address issues of race and class. Many folks in her position have opted to \"throw in the towel,\" as working across these lines proves to be incredibly challenging, but Kari has patiently stuck it out. She has worked with many of the same folks, sat through incredibly disheartening conversations and sometimes campaigns, and still she perseveres because she believes in this work and the long term vision. ',4,'Kari works to empower young people, even when she was a student she mentored other students and young people. Right after she graduated college, I hired her to work for EJCC because I saw that her relationship with other students on her campus would be the perfect foundation for her to work with students on other campuses. She isn\'t overbearing in her style -- she leads by example, makes sure people are taken care of, and asks questions that allow young people to dive deep into their perspectives. ',4,'Since I have known Kari, she has shown herself to be incredibly curious-- whether about the mechanics of a bike or the history of particular social change movements. She has always had a lot on her plate and yet she still finds time to satisfy her curious edge. I believe that is what has brought her to code for progress. In 2009 Kari founded \"check the weather,\" which started off as an online portal to discuss issues of environmental racism, climate change, and movement building. It expanded to start documenting solutions to climate change and following Lisa Jacksons career in the EPA. Since, check the weather\'s founding she has learned as much as she could on how best to run a site, build a following, and manage incoming content. I know if she had more support in this endeavor, her work would flourish. ',4,'In my experience, Kari doesn\'t shy away from leaning on her community if she needs it, though, she is often one of the first to lend her support to those in need.\r\n\r\nIn our time working together, any challenges she was experiencing she would ask for help or advice. Even after we stopped working together on the daily -- we\'d still find time to meet up and discuss our work broadly providing feedback or insight where helpful. ','Before Kari even started working for EJCC, in the organization there was a lack of defined structure. As a result, I am pretty certain Kari has never had a strong manager to help guide her work. Additionally, most employees and students that EJCC works with have been spread out all over the country-- I know from my own experience that this kind of decentralization can also be demotivating. \r\n\r\nThough Kari has done tremendously well in spite of these challenges, I know that a supportive community that is there to give helpful feedback and provide clear avenues of communication will only help her become a stronger leader. \r\nI think that clear structures of communication and deadlines that are straightforward will also be incredibly helpful. \r\n\r\nShe does have a new baby so I imagine asking her the question, \"How can we best support you to be successful?\" will in and of itself be a good exercise and help her feel supported.

It was a huge trial trying to figure out where six grown people instead of five could sleep in a tiny apartment.\r\n\r\nShe found these weird air-sucking bags on Amazon after doing tons of research, which compressed the clothes and blankets she didn\'t need to have immediate access to.

I think one of them brought bed bugs from their luggage which infested her whole apartment and both of us as well - gross and scary, I know. The whole suite - two rooms full of Nadia\'s stuff-had to be cleaned out for the exterminators. She lived on the second floor of an older building that had no elevators.

She sews ties, and then she takes them apart and sews them again using different stitch patterns. She takes my mom\'s old sarees, rips them apart, and puts them back together again. The end result is not wearable - she\'s still working on that. The point is, she is not just curious about how things are taken apart, she is also interested in how they are put back together. \r\n\r\nAt Code for Progress, I want her experience there to help her look into and understand people, humans, on a deeper level - not just things.

She was also a volunteer with the university\'s Graduation Pledge Alliance which urges students to pledge to \"explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job I consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which I work.\" Ms. Perez was also a teaching aid to communication professor, Max Schnurer, where she explored issues in community organizing and advocacy. Finally, during the time I knew her, Ms. Perez was also involved with our local Planned Parenthood program--all this while she was working a full time job in our marketing & communications department.\r\n',5,'I would say Ms. Perez is very creative when it comes to solving problems. As a writer she was tasked with finding ways to present stories in new and interesting ways on a daily basis--stories that would often have to be retold or were stories that developed over a series of essays. Keeping reader interest in this process is a key skill that Ms. Perez definitely possesses. One specific example was when Ms. Perez was tasked with developing content for a website that featured environmental sustainability on the HSU campus. To complete this task, Ms. Perez created a web of sticky notes, each one containing a specific content piece for the site. After much work, an intricate web of stories, profiles, tips and facts were compiled into a well functioning website. Ms. Perez\'s creative approach to understanding the site\'s content needs were a great example of her approach to problem solving.\r\n',5,'I credit Ms. Perez with a lot of patience, since much of working in the writing field is waiting for stories to develop or story sources to return phone calls or emails. To her credit, Ms. Perez was always willing to give lengthy writing projects the time they needed to develop into something compelling. Furthermore, as you can see in my first response, Ms. Perez likes to keep her schedule full, which allows her to keep her areas of interest occupied as projects progress.\r\n',5,'Ms. Perez is highly interested in teaching and mentorship as evidenced by her work as a teaching aid with Prof. Max SChnurer and as a member of Six Rivers Planned Parenthood. I would even argue her interest in journalism is driven by her desire to educate her community and bring awareness to issues of concern.\r\n',5,'Again, I point to Ms. Perez\'s work with Prof. Max Schnurer. Ms. Perez was always interested in social justice issues, so working closely with a communication professor who specializes in social movement and freedom was an excellent way for Desiree to improve her communication skills. Furthermore, as a student journalism at Humboldt State, it was her role to investigate issues of concern to the student community--so not only did she master the tools of video and radio production, she became an expert in higher education issues from the point of view of student, faculty and administration.',5,'As her former editor when Ms. Perez worked as a marketing & communications writer, my desk was one of the first places she would seek advice when working on a story. She never hesitated to get input during the development of story, whereas many other writers in my experience, keep their work close to their chest until it\'s finished. Also to that point, I think in general if Ms. Perez is curious about something she\'s not only willing to ask for help, she\'s more than willing to roll up her sleeves and dig into the project, whether it\'s with the Planned Parenthood program, the Graduation Pledge Alliance or serving as a teaching aid to an upper-division communication course.\r\n','Ms. Perez likes to be kept busy, so as long as this program can occupy her curiosity in a multitude of ways, she\'ll excel. \r\n','Ms. Perez is highly curious, highly skilled and highly committed to succeeding at any task she puts her mind to.

It is important to support her in this journey as first generation. She is making her family and her friends proud.  ','Code for progress sounds like a great next step for Aurea, her grace and talents will be a benefit for the teachers and attendees alike. She would be best supported if there is an approach to activism and justice for all communities in the discussions, lessons, and work. She leads from behind, and for her to attend and acquire the skills to connect people, and mobilize folks in technology space will only propel her and the people that she comes into contact with in the future. ',1,NULL),(1130,1076,116,5,'I believe that Aurea is deeply committed to these forms of justice since I have personally witnessed how she has organized and led actions that challenge inequalities. Specifically, I recall Aurea organizing an retreat for an immigrant support group at UC Santa Barbara. Aurea ensured that the retreat created a safer space for undocumented students that often can not share their stories. ',5,'Aurea was chosen to facilitate an introduction to a conference for undocumented youth. Since Aurea wanted to make students feel welcome as soon as they sat in the auditorium before the start of the conference, she put together a video of all the organizers proudly declaring \"I am undocumented and unafraid.\" Aurea was able to use her media skills to create a short film that not only challenged problematic conceptualizations of undocumented immigrants but also indicated how an undocumented identity can be empowering. This moment was especially meaningful for many of the students at the conference who were never able to publicly acknowledge their undocumented identities. ',5,'I believe that Aurea demonstrates an incredible amount of patience. Even when things are very difficult and she is struggling to solve a problem she always has a smile on her face and is willing to do whatever she can to work through obstacles. Aurea not only has patience but also a very positive attitude that has helped her move forward with her goals.',5,'Aurea has served as a mentor for many youth, especially immigrant youth. I believe that since Aurea did not navigate higher education on her own, she has gone out of her way to give back to the community. Aurea has served as a mentor for students that look at her experiences as examples of what they can achieve. ',5,'I believe that since Aurea chose to major in Sociology and Black Studies she has acknowledged a desire to understand how society is structured and how systems (like inequality) are reproduced. Rather than accepting what is normalized, Aurea is critical of how society is organized to privilege some populations over others. I believe that by embodying a sociological approach, she has demonstrated a keen desire to explain how things work. ',5,'When Aurea was in high school she was able to apply to many scholarships that helped her finance her college education. I believe that this indicates how willing Aurea is to ask for help because it is often difficult for someone to even realize that they need help in the first place. In the time I have known Aurea, I have realized that she asks for help even when she is uncertain if she can obtain the help. I feel that Aurea understands that many of the things she wants to accomplish can not be done individually. Rather, Aurea takes a collective approach to accomplish her goals. ','I feel like many youth who are struggling with an unDACAmented identity, creating a more inclusive space for not only Aurea but other undocumented youth and allies is crucial. I believe that an inclusive environment that takes into account not only the personal identities of people that participate in the program but are also allies would help create and bolster a strong and productive environment. ','I believe that supporting Aurea\'s commitment to grassroots organizing is especially important. I also acknowledge that Code for Progress can help challenge how underrepresented communities need a larger presence in the tech field.

Her family has overcome many difficulties, particularly in regards to her education.

Upon her return from college, Aurea began working in the local after school programs, using her knowledge and experience to remove barriers for other kids.  While in college she served as an intern with Mika Community Development Corporation one summer for local students, helping them with literacy and recreation.  Additionally, I know that she sees her role as a big sister as a mentoring role for her younger siblings.  Aurea is one of a small handful of college graduates who have returned to our neighborhood to invest in others.',5,'One of the reasons Aurea came on as an intern with Mika CDC was to see the inner workings of a non-profit organization.  She returned to several organizations that she had been involved with as a kid to peel back the layers and see what we were about.  I was moved by her curiosity and doggedness in seeking truth and the motivations behind the work.  It was good accountability for me as a leader of a community organization.

There wasn\'t a primary campaign in Florida that year and so when we got there we had to build out a field organization with very little in the way of existing infrastructure.

This was a very creative (and successful) solution. ',5,'Taylor is tremendously persistent. The local Democrats in Collier County during 2008 were disorganized and were run by a couple of highly dysfunctional and incompetent people.

In the end things worked out perfectly.',5,'Taylor personally taught me how to work the VAN data base.  He taught me to cut turf and taught me many other things.

This seems like a no-brainer for a student, but there were some trade-offs. Duke is known for its cohort feel. The university has a high 4-year graduation rate and students remain friends with their graduating class for decades. By choosing this experience, Taylor gave up some of that, graduating in a class in which he knew few of the students.  But he worked through the process and was able to make the most of his time at Duke, even choosing to study abroad as a senior.  I have never met someone who has done that before here.

',1,NULL),(1147,1096,884,5,'Working on progressive campaigns in New Jersey and Delaware, Craig has demonstrated his dedication to racial, gender, and economic justice by championing the very ideals that the campaigns supported. Craig is one of the most accepting, embracing, and progressive individuals I have had the opportunity to work with in the field. As a member of the Sweeney, Burzichelli, and Riley campaign, Craig was on the ground educating the community on the issue of economic equality in southern New Jersey. Middle class stability and equal economic opportunity were priorities for the campaign, and as Craig’s first taste in electoral politics, he embraced that mission and ran with it.  He used those messages to inspire the canvassers who he was charged with supervising in the final days leading up to the election in November.  He worked to educate them on the issues of the campaign, and got his team excited about the impact that their work would have if our candidates won.  Furthermore, on the Delaware campaign, Craig’s recruitment efforts helped diversify our team of canvassers.  While most of our canvassers came from the University of Delaware, which has a relatively homogenous and affluent student body, Craig’s efforts to recruit beyond the UD campus ensured that our team more closely reflected the demographics of the surrounding neighborhoods.  ',4,'Craig went above and beyond his prescribed role as canvass supervisor throughout his time in New Jersey. One key example sticks out in my mind. In the final days leading up to the election, we had to coordinate with multiple car rental agencies, nine campaign offices, and our financial subsidiary to disperse 28 15-passenger vans across New Jersey. This created a logistical nightmare, but Craig stepped up the plate, offered his advice and leadership, and created a plan which was beyond any role which he was charged to fill. Without Craig’s creative thinking and problem solving capabilities, I am not sure we would have been able to coordinate all aspects of our statewide “van-plan” in the necessary time frame. He drew on his vast network in New Jersey, organized driving routes, and worked over time to see that the job was done. In the end, 28 vans moved from three rental locations in New Jersey to nine campaign office, all within the span of 3 hours.  Craig’s intuitive thinking and ability to mobilize and motivate people was the crux of this operation. ',5,'The campaign that Craig worked on in Newark, DE was brief but rife with challenges.  One of our primary difficulties was deficient recruiting—we simply did not have the bodies to get the job done in the final week before the election, primarily because much of our canvassers were University of Delaware students who were preparing to leave campus for Thanksgiving break.  Craig was brought in as a recruitment specialist, and he delivered.  He first recognized that while we were not hitting the number of canvassers that we needed, it would be best to shift our efforts to recruiting for a day or two and build up our off-campus recruitment database.  Though this pushed us further behind in terms of shifts going into the field, and thus required a great deal of patience, it was a good decision in the long-term.  While we fell further behind for two days, it was important to make that sacrifice so that we could achieve our end goal.  In addition to temporarily redirecting our efforts toward recruiting in person, Craig is a master of telephone recruitment.  He spends hours calling canvassers, long after his shift has officially ended, convincing them to bring friends, and convincing their friends to bring friends, all over the phone.  His skill comes from the fact that he leaves no stone unturned.  He makes no assumptions about who it’s “worth it” to call, treating every conversation as though that one canvasser will make the difference between winning and losing a campaign.  This degree of diligence was invaluable to meeting our goals, and I’m sure that it contributed to our candidate’s success.      ',5,'As a supervisor for three campaigns, Craig’s job was to educate, train, and motivate his team of canvassers. Craig’s enthusiasm, optimism, and desire to make sure each and every person knew what they were supposed to be doing as they were going door-to-door was remarkable.  Craig was skilled at speaking to his team as a group, providing all the information they needed to know without getting caught in the proverbial weeds.  At the same time, he was always willing to engage personally with team members to address specific problems.  His personal drive for success is exceeded only by his desire to see his individual team members meet and exceed their goals.  This duel level of motivation, on top of his dedication to progressive politics writ large, created an environment that fostered effective learning for his team.  It’s no wonder that Craig was one of our most effective supervisors on the campaign, and consistently led teams of canvassers that exceeded our expectations.  ',4,'As long as I’ve known him, Craig has never been afraid to ask questions.  While working in Glassboro as a supervisor, Craig wanted to know how his work in southern New Jersey was contributing the larger campaign across the state.  He wanted to know what other races we were involved in, how did phones and mail work into the campaign plan, and what kinds of canvasses were being sent out in the central and northern parts of the state.  After I mentioned that a whole other independent expenditure campaign was happening on the other side of the “wall,” his questions delved into campaign finance and issues that, I had to admit, I wasn’t completely sure of myself.  As a result of Craig’s curiosity, I found that I was learning a lot that I didn’t know about the structure of our campaign.        ',5,'Craig recognizes that he does not know all the ins-and-outs of campaign politics, and when he needs help or advice, he reaches out. When the New Jersey race was wrapping up in early November, Craig came to me and asked how he could continue participating in progressive campaigns.  He clearly liked campaign work, but he didn’t know how to continue what he learned in the field in New Jersey to other states, other regions, other races. He knew that I had some experience and a few key connections, and he was willing to open up and express his interests, concerns, and excitement in moving forward in the organization and the campaign world in general. \r\n\r\nWhen Craig was invited to come to DC to help with a petition campaign, he did not hesitate to ask how to do this new job. Petition collection is, after all, very different from issue advocacy. The job is unique, challenging, and demanding.  At first, Craig was unfamiliar with Washington, so he asked the DC residents on his team where the best locations would be, what time of day would have the most passersby, and how best to deploy his canvassers.  \r\n\r\nAs with any new job, he felt overwhelmed on his first day.  His team did not meet the goals he had set, so he asked us what best practices we had learned in the weeks before he joined the team.  Rather than suffer through the same blunders that we made before his arrival, Craig had the wherewithal to ask how he could avoid the mistakes that we already made. \r\n','As a native of New Jersey, Craig has a solid network of friends and acquaintances across New Jersey and Philadelphia (he recruited most of them to canvass for the campaign in November).  However, Craig will be a newcomer to Washington, DC.  I imagine he will not have a strong support network or much of a social circle.  Therefore, I hope that Code for Progress will help him adjust to living in a new city and help him become integrated into a new community.','I think the most important thing that the Code for Progress team can do to support Craig is to keep him engaged in the work at hand.  As I mentioned earlier, Craig is intensely curious, and this curiosity can potentially lead to distraction if he is not being challenged and pushed to achieve goals.  I think it’s important to keep him focused, and to show how the work he is doing fits into the bigger picture of his education, his career, and the progressive movement.

He dealt with each program participant in a professional and empathetic manner, without regard to their racial, gender, or economic status. He even advocated on behalf of these participants for outside agency services that they were potentially eligible to receive.  ',5,'Craig thoroughly demonstrates creativity in problem solving. He worked directly with several different age groups and practiced problem resolution when conflict arose among the different students. Craig would use his charm and exuberant personality to help calm the students and redirect their attention to create more positive experiences.',5,'During various training sessions, Craig demonstrated patience in fully grasping and comprehending certain information, policies, and procedures. He would ask questions and reiterate scenarios utilizing the information to test his understanding and knowledge.

Notably, she is a Tongan immigrant that came to this country on a student visa to pursue a higher education in order to help advance the plight of her family, and her community, in the United States.  In the six years that I have mentored Fifita, she has taken every opportunity offered to her, as an international student, to fulfill her aim to be a student of society in order to give back to her community.  In that place, she has been an advocate at the local, state, and national level to advance the voice of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders in the community.  She understands the disparities presented by racial, gender, and economic divisions in the communities.  Through her many opportunities, Fifita has been able to work with the underserved communities of Southern California through the UCLA Labor Center.  Her advocacy through various legislative visits have provided insight into the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LBGT) community through phone banking with the Asian & Pacific Islander Equality-Los Angeles chapter, who advocate for the rights of the LGBT community.  She has also been involved with advocacy efforts through her internship and volunteer efforts with the Tongan Community Service Center for data disaggregation of the Tongan community, an impoverished and marginalized community in Los Angeles County, which makes up one of the largest concentrations of Tongans in the United States.  Although one person, Fifita’s ability to integrate the needs and issues of the overall Asian and Pacific Islander community into her pursuit to equalize the representation of this community in the United States’ narrative, speaks to her passion to bring our communities to the conversation.  Fifita’s many experiences has, not only brought her to better understanding of the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community, it has also broadened her understanding of the disparities in other marginalized communities such as the Latino, African American, Asian, LGBT, and underserved communities.  It has also broadened her advocacy efforts for all underserved communities.    ',4,'Fifita has been part of numerous youth advisory boards for many community projects.  When you scrutinize her experiences, she has been part of projects that has expanded knowledge and collaboration across communities.  From my direct experience with Fifita, she has been integral in the launch of the Citizenship Workshop project by the Tongan Community Service Center.  Fifita provided translation for flyers that enabled more than 100 Pacific Islander families to obtain their citizenship through this project.  Her work outreached to families from outside of California to contact and participate in the naturalization process for their families.  As a result, more than a dozen families voted in 2012 because they were able to be naturalized and informed through a voter engagement project that Fifita led in the Tongan community as an extension of this citizenship process.  \r\nAdditionally, as part of her internship with the Asian and Pacific Islander Obesity Prevention Alliance, Fifita organized the Bike to Tonga project, whose aim is to encourage physical activity for a community that is about 70% overweight and obese.  As the pilot of the project, Fifita organized and coordinated a bike ride that brought 20 young Tongan youth to explore the ways that they can utilize their physical environments to build a healthier lifestyle. ',5,'Fifita came to the United States through a student visa.  As a result of the economic downturn, her family was unable to afford her international tuition at the community college, and in turn, her student visa expired.  As a result, Fifita was unable to attend community college anymore.  \r\nIn turn, Fifita turned to community work to continue her education.  She saw an opportunity to expand her education through volunteering and interning for community organizations that will provide her with expanded knowledge of systems and structures of power.  Fifita has applied to internships that allow her status, in order to save money for her to go back to school.  This has been the biggest demonstration of patience through obstacles that I have witnessed through a student.  She continues to look for every opportunity that doesn\'t restrict her because of her status in order for her to continue to learn.  Proudly, I can say that Fifita began to take classes at the community college again this year because she interned and saved her money in order to go back to school. ',5,'I came to know Fifita through an women\'s empowerment group I started in 2008 called Ta\'ahine \'O Moana (Girls of the Ocean).  Because Fifita was already part of the leadership of her local church youth group, she began to bring other young women to the group.  She saw this opportunity as her way of exposing young Pacific Islander women who were born and raised in the United States, to a greater cultural understanding that contextualized their experiences as young women in this country.  Gradually, she joined many networks of students and young leaders, and began to utilize her social media presence and influence, to expose and engage these young members to the potential of being leaders in the community.  There are numerous young leaders groomed in the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community because of Fifita\'s leadership and mentorship.\r\nFifita is also a founding member for the Faith Advisory Board, which is a board made up of young leaders from different religious denominations in the Tongan community, aimed at bringing healthy lifestyles to the young leaders and members of the Tongan faith communities.    \r\n',4,'Fifita demonstrates her curiosity for how things work through the variety of opportunities she has pursued.  She began with many advisory and advocacy roles at the Tongan Community Service Center and Ta\'ahine \'O Moana.  Now, she has expanded her knowledge to the LGBT community, undocumented community, and other underserved communities.  \r\nFifita has so much potential for making a difference in the community and needs more opportunities to build her skills and expand her skills to integrating other areas of work into her plethora of work.    ',5,'Although I have mentored Fifita over the last 6 years, she remains one of the young leaders that continues to ask for advice and feedback.  This trait shows how much growth Fifita seeks and the potential she has for growth because although she has been part of an extensive body of work, she is still curious and seeking for knowledge.  Fifita asks for insight about what opportunities she seeks, about projects she has in mind for the community, what kinds of classes she seeks for her future, and how to be a better community leader.  ','The main challenge for this applicant, which applies across the board for all our Pacific Islander applicants, is that they come from a very impoverished community that recognizes the need to be at this level of work.  This means that their parents don\'t have the means to support them financially to support them in any way away from home.  This means, these students will need to find all the financial support they can find in order for them to pursue these means because they see its need for their careers and for the advancement of the community.  These are our first generation trailblazers and will seek all support that can be given to them.  This also means that they\'re the first in their families, in their communities, to reach these heights and need the structural and personal support one would get in their situations.  ','The main thing that a Pacific Islander student would need in this situation is to feel a sense of belonging to a greater sense of achieving social justice for their community.  In many, if not all situations, we are the invisible community and it is easy to assume that their experiences reflect everyone else\'s.  In most cases, their values and needs are different, but a sense of belonging and relevance will help them find their place and aid them relate their experience to their families and communities.  This is, often, what makes the difference for them.  They will apply themselves in greater extent, they will engage more meaningfully, and learn in greater depths.

I tend to be a little slower to do things and I would often rely a lot on academics to validate circumstances. I\'ve learned from her that sometimes believing in something is enough reason to do it, even without academic validation. You don\'t need a diploma to be an expert in your experiences. There are just some things that demand action.   ','Over the years I\'ve learned to really own my story and experiences and, in turn, be humbled when a community member feels safe in sharing theirs. I\'ve learned that I can\'t nor should I ever speak on behalf of or try to liberate or empower anyone- that\'s theirs to own. It\'s easy to forget or not acknowledge ones privilege in different spaces but I\'ve become keenly aware of my own. Whenever possible in my work, even outside of organizing, I\'ll bring this up.','Throughout my time working within social justice circles, I\'ve met many people I\'ve grown to love and admire. One of those individuals is Mo, an amazing person and a fountain of knowledge. Mo has a tremendous facility of explaining some of the most complex issues in the clearest terms without diminishing importance or impact. They have more life experience in the 30 some years they\'ve been alive and more passion for liberation than almost anyone I know.','I\'m not sure if I\'m formally mentoring any one person. The closest I\'ve come to mentorship is working with the other volunteers that make up our organization. We all take each other under our wings and learn from each other in the process. There are, however, a couple volunteers with whom I\'m working with one on one to develop their skills in multimedia and design work and with whom I speak with frequently at a friend capacity.','I always admired how structured and focused this individual was in their leadership capacity. Unlike my more informal and sometimes inefficiently time-managed approach, their meetings would always have a purpose and an end goal which had to be reached within a specific time frame. They also knew how to intuitively and effectively bring a group of people together and maximize their potential whereas I always tend toward focusing on individual connections.','I had the opportunity to meet some amazing professors at college who weren\'t afraid to push their students to the next level. After a final review of a semester\'s worth of work, my professor approached me and told me, \"Do better.\" Advice that was simple, blunt and to the point- you can always do better (at least that\'s how I take it now. It sounds better in retrospect, though). I now see everything as a process that can always be worked on and improved. ','Community members have had bad experiences with lawyers in the area and service providers who have either taken their money and never rendered service, or have provided misinformation regarding the specific situations the community members have inquired about. In an area where base and coalition building is primarily based on trust and one-on-ones, it\'s extremely important for community members to be able to distinguish trustworthy entities.','My idea is to design a phone application with four main objectives: 1. Reputable service provider finder (from immigration lawyers to organizations-for legal purposes or social), 2. Know Your Rights/Detention101 information that users can refer to in worst case scenarios (basic rights, numbers to call based on where zip code and detention centers in the area), 3. An option to report and document a human rights abuse, 4. Raid/Checkpoint Text Alerts','It would be great if FaceTime offered a way to screenshare or to share music while simultaneously on a call. Also, an option to set timers to end video calls would help as sometimes folks fall asleep when talking to each other resulting in dead phones the next day. In regards to VSCO Cam, Instagram and other photo sharing apps, making one inclusive app that has photo effects, collaging options, Squareready features and video would make everything easier.','I spend a large part of my time with my family.

','As a college student I help found a local organization of Dreamers. Our goal was to encourage undocumented students in high school to continue their education. Those same high school students joined our organization and continue to run campaigns protecting in-state tuition rates for undocumented students and are fighting against draconian immigration laws both in state and national level.

She has the ability to not only handle an enormous workload but she is able to do so in a way that puts all of our coworkers at ease. Her ability to remain focused and empowered despite facing an endless number of obstacles is very inspiring and it is the reason I would ask her to mentor me.

I have come to realize that pausing to breath not only helps me to take care of myself, but it also helps me become more productive at work. ','One of the biggest problems faced in my community are deportations.There has been countless cases in which undocumented immigrants are detained due to frivolous offensives such as traffic stops. Many of the individuals detained have minimal knowledge and resources to help themselves from deportation.The immigration system is broken and it is important to help stop deportations and provide some relief to families and communities that are in constant fear.','I would make a program that would educate the community on how to protect themselves from deportation.

I show new research assistants how to schedule appointments, update logs and the database of participants, and run the studies.

','Jewell Alingasa, former core member of ASPIRE LA, is committed, headstrong, and quick to make decisions.

','People tell me to stop over-thinking and learn to move on. I am my worst critic, and sometimes it is difficult to be satisfied. That leads to what-if scenarios and second guessing, both which are time consuming and stressful. People also tell me to not take things too personally. Both criticisms were given so that I could work effectively without becoming compromised. When I stop worrying and overanalyzing, I can get things done better and more quickly.','There is a high need for medical, psychological, and mental health services for my underserved and underprivileged immigrant, undocumented, and low-income community. Preventive check-ups and other health services are important because my community is composed of minimum wagers who cannot afford to miss a day of work because of illness. A missed day can make the difference of having or not having food on the table. (We do not get social security benefits.)','A strictly-regulated application for the undocumented or low-income presenting free to low-cost medical services by GPS will positively impact the health of communities. The services and their costs (if any) would be listed by alphabetical order or categorized by the type of service (i.e. check-ups, laboratory tests). For those in need of immediate help, (i.e. urgent care, suicide prevention) a chatting/texting/calling hotline would be accessible 24/7.','I access most social media through my phone, and I have a pet peeve with automatic feed updating. Sometimes I am still reading posts or going back and forth between posts (mainly in Facebook and Instagram), and I lose sight of a post or image I was interested in because of the feed\'s automatic refreshing. This feature should be optional. There should be a swiping signal that updates the feed when one wants it or needs it or an on and off button for it.','I spend my time on activism, research, and people. Activism is rewarding because I get to meet new people, learn new things, and empower my community. As for research, I work at the UCLA Baby Lab, which focuses on developmental research.

I always felt like I had a lot to share and when transitioning from leadership to organizer I was told I needed to take the time to listen more. I think it was a key lesson for me, and it made me better as a human being and as an organizer. Giving people time and space to think through problems on their own, and guiding them through that process, has led to the best work I\'ve seen done so far!!','One thing I always thought was challenging was maintaining lines of communication open and building community amongst people when they weren\'t physically interacting. Between doing work across several cities and how busy people are with work and schools, it was always tough to keep people interacting directly with one another (as opposed to w/ the organizers). I think for any organizing to work, people have to breed a sense of family with one another.','When I was younger I used to use online bulletin boards for gaming clans, and it helped keep hundreds of people in contact in an organized way. I\'d like to create an app that would accomplish something similar, like a GroupMe with different layers.

This training will give me the tools I need to switch career paths and create real change while working with non-profits and providing a unique perspective to the tech that works them.','Working with a non-profit that impacts the global community, particularly women in developing countries would be great. Whether the technology I provide helps to move people and supplies more effectively, increase communication amongst its volunteers, puts applications in the hands of the people that it impacts, or all of the above it would feel great to make a difference.',' Growing up on Capitol Hill taught me about justice, no one person could take the credit. Growing up in an area where those advocating for social justice were constantly buzzing around me had the largest impact. These experiences taught me that justice is not guaranteed, particularly for minority groups, without strategic and persistent action.','Speaking at the United States Capitol with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids for FDA for regulation of tobacco products and being a part of policy change in high school was invaluable. Later, tutoring children at an elementary school in the Anacostia area of DC instilled the importance of my presence in my community. ','My ideal mentor would be a female that is involved in a start up or began a non-profit. Someone that has effectively led a team and made a way in male dominated industries or a difference in the lives of women. I have asked a woman like this to mentor me, and she offers great, direct, advice. ','I wouldn\'t say that I am currently mentoring anyone, to be honest.','The person I\'m thinking of gets buy-in and respect by sincerely caring about each person\'s personal and professional lives. She asks \"How are you?\" in a way that expects more than a one word answers, and follows up, with everyone. To do this in such a sincere way with every person is a skillI hope to someday grow into. My background leans toward keeping very separate professional and personal lives. I lead by exchanging knowledge and overcoming obstacles.','I have been told that I need to learn when to build a door rather than to knock down a wall. This was great advice for me. I become passionate and focused when I decide that something is the right thing to do. My tunnel vision always gets the job done but sometimes I could have  accomplished my goal with more elegance and grace. ','Lack of community is a large problem that affects my community. Urban environments have a wealth a skills and services to trade. If it were possible to trade and barter services and knowledge like childcare, auto advice (I use a neighbor for this frequently), cooking skills etc., it would create an invaluable marketplace. Things that seemed expensive and inconvenient now become a simple trade off and form trust and responsibility in your community. ','My app would allow people to post skills that they can offer and skills that they need. It would allow for pictures and have a verification system from other neighbors and peer reviews. Perhaps someone like me would be willing to trade a few hours of childcare in exchange for a delicious home cooked meal (or maybe a lesson on how to do it myself). ','My health insurance has an app that allows me to find doctors and quickly contact health professionals to make appointments. I wish this were further integrated with all health systems and could allow me to quickly fill out paper work, manage co-payments, and find available appts. Considering the current health care climate, a health care app and system that could be more universally implemented and transparent to the patient would be great.

','This training will equip me with a technology skill set to reach communities that are often overlooked in a progressive space.','I plan to seek out non-profit work, likely in a communications or research position.','Jessica Morales, a friend of mine who is active in DC social justice, encouraged me to explore how I can use my voice and my power to enact change in my community. She has organized rallies for Trayvon Martin, immigration reform, and several other issues that target marginalized people. These have inspired me greatly. In fact, she was the person who directed me to Code For Progress. ','After seeing how much impact one person can have, I started volunteering, first with OneBrick, and then with Martha\'s Table and Martha\'s Outfitters. Then, I decided to leave my career as a paralegal to work directly with people in my community who seek social justice.  ','I might ask Tahir Duckett, an activist and friend, who has worked at Working America for years, and is starting a nonprofit called Rethink that helps break down the cultural norms underpinning rape and sexual assault. ','I currently provide support for my two younger sisters--Christine, who is working toward her Master\'s in Biomechanics at Johns Hopkins, and Crystal, who is studying English at the University of Maryland. I give advice and connect them with other individuals who can help them achieve their goals. ','I volunteered with RootsCamp this year, and I got the opportunity to work with Mikey Franklin. His leadership style is quick and efficient, but often relies on delegating roles to the rest of the team. My style allows team members to figure out where they feel most comfortable and where their skills might be best applied. ','I have been encouraged to assert myself more. Often in large groups, I tend to seek the best possible outcome for the group by sitting back and allowing things to develop organically. This can sometimes be problematic because people like me, who are less vocal in some circumstances, don\'t get a chance to be heard. The advice is good because it addresses an evident problem and immediately offers a solution. ','One problem our community faces is an underinformed voting base. If individuals don\'t know the differences between candidates, they don\'t see the need to vote. A politically apathetic community can\'t make change through legislation.','One way to address voter indifference is to create a free app that compiles candidate fact sheets for local elections. This way, individuals can find out about candidates\' platforms before elections. Ideally, the fact sheets would be put together long before election day and updated in real time. Then, they could be periodically bumped, more and more often, until election day. ','I regularly use Twitter. I use it to link to articles I find interesting, to talk with friends, and to air my thoughts out. One way to improve Twitter is to separate some of these aspects from one another within the app. There are other apps, like Tweetdeck that can filter and have a great user interface, but having these as features of Twitter would streamline the process. ','In addition to volunteering, I spend a lot of time playing guitar and reading. I think these three hobbies give me the opportunity to meet new people, or if I want, to retreat and have some valuable time alone, while still learning about myself and the world around me.

These communities have been, through out our history -and are currently- marginalized and exploited, as such, we are excluded from these fields of work -at least relative to other more prominent demographics. A saddening fact, considering the amount of potential and intelligence that is dormant in these communities, this is a loss to society. ','I\'ve not had much luck finding consistent work -Even with my recent attainment of a \"Legal status\" through DACA. I was working as a temporary worker. But, that was very inconsistent and short lived, I was sadly let go off. Under my current responsibilities is my volunteer role in the immigrant rights network United We Dream (UWD). that consist primarily of strategic and tactical thinking, all done through communications with our affiliates on the ground.','Many significant things: Including, 1) Ability to create functional ways of communication between different bodies of the org, as well as with the community it seeks to serve. \r\n2) Creating tools to facilitate specific goals within a campaign (E.g. getting X number of community members to sign up).\r\n3) broadening the audience/membership reached by my org via creative software that is available and easy to access to a broad -in many cases, new- public.\r\n ','Ideally, I\'ll seek to serve community/social justice organizations, such as the one that I\'ve been involve with (United We Dream, Voces De La Frontera and Youth Empowered in the Struggle), in a capacity that seeks to align itself with, and take advantage of, current technological possibilities. In other words, I seek to serve as a software/application creator and \"creative tool engineer\" in order to move the org/s I\'ll serve forward towards their goals!','I\'ve learn that there is wisdom in us all, if we willingly listen. However, I\'ll like highlight Christine Neumann-Ortiz (E.D. of Voces De La Frontera). She is an individual that thought me to, first and foremost, seek to serve the needs of my community, know the potential that can be unleashed by empowering individuals, seek to always understand the social shifts necessary to obtain justice, and, lastly, always serve by example and fearless leadership.','I let go of the heavy veil of fear that I\'ve carried since arriving in this country. I took to organizing and mobilization of my community in order to create concrete change in the policies that undermine my community\'s potential. By seeking to grow and the needed skills, I\'ve become a leader; the goal always to seek justice by empowering others. I\'ve been privilege to do this on a national level as National Coordinator Committee member of United We Dream.','I\'d seek Celso Mireles (Former online organizer for UWD) as mentor. He undertook key parts of our campaigns: creating and sustaining a website, designing media/online materials. He\'s also always seeking novel ways to tap into technologies and resources -such as the \"Dreamer Hackathon\" he led in late 2013. Some of the crucial parts of organizing are behind the \"front-lines\", he is a key example of this, I\'ve grown to admire this style of leadership.','I\'m currently mentor to a younger leader, named Rafa. Since his initial involvement he has looked up to me for advice and leadership. Above all, I seek for him to, in a deep level, understand the circumstances and injustice that surround him and his community and that his duty is to serve and empower new leadership and his community. I also train him (and others) in practical and important aspects of organizing (E.g. story telling, strategy, outreach, etc)','Carlos Savedraas\' and Carlos Rojas\' (former and current UWD leadership) style of leadership have always made an impression on me. They are forefront leaders, meaning that they are comfortable and outspoken in public, natural socializers, and charismatic leaders, always able to connect to people with ease. They simply connect and impact folks in a sometimes deeply emotional way, a thing that as as socially awkward person I always admire in people.  ','I often tend take a subtle approach to my organizing. Often preferring to simmer on my ideas rather than speaking out and letting others step up to the front. Which can be good, but offers down sides, in that sometimes the situation calls to be outspoken and to take matters in to my own hands. This \"shy\" tendencies have been pointed out by my peers with positive results. I\'ve grown more confident in my leadership and will step up to leadership with ease. ','Misinformation or complete lack of reliable sources of information regarding legal rights or changes to policy as well as lack of ways to directly --and easily- petition to our elected officials. I believe those are critical problems in our communities.There are possible solutions: The internet age offers information and knowledge, the most valuable concepts, as well as instant world wide connection! We simply need the tools to facilitate their attainment.','I\'d like to create an app that shows alerts regarding policy changes, information, news that effect the community and events that folks can attend.  The app will also have ways to connect folks with other folks within the org, they\'ll be able to post petitions and ideas that others can sign up to. Lastly, it will contain a resources tab that will prompt them to resources such as lawyers, scholarships or a contact person that can aid the app user directly.','One of the most successful formats out there is that of Facebook. Though, to serve it\'s purpose as an organizing tool it can be a bit cluttered. If we are too use the format efficiently following alterations are called: it has to be controlled and tailored to community. While members can be able to access each others postings and profiles, there would be a separate feed with official postings from the org which include updates, news, events, and resources.','I have three main passions. The first is my family and loved ones, I seek to bond, love and serve them. The second is doing my part to realize the potential our human societies can be, the most pragmatic way to do this, I\'ve found out, is organizing. The third is an innate drive to learn and to improve as a person: I\'m keen to self teaching new subjects, specially in the fields of philosophy and political theory.

If I’m not able to attend school this fall I will be looking for employment in an after school program or a community center to help students with their education. ','My first year of college I met an Elementary teacher, Monserrat Garibay who taught students in a low-income neighborhood. She was an advocate for her students and their education and it might sound cliché but I learned that they are our future. She speaks up about the injustices of cutting back funding from schools and how it affects the student. ','I like to say I’m following Monserrat’s footstep by being involved in my community. I still go back to my old high school and help undocumented students apply to college and guide them through other processes. Whenever my local politician, state representative, or congressman brings up education I let them know my opinion. ','One of the persons who I have been following for a few years is a Board of Director member of our local independent school district. Not only is he a graduate from my high school but he was also a Mayor of San Antonio a few years back. I have seen him turn around our school district and seen major improvements in my old high school.','I don’t consider myself a mentor at this point of life just because I’m still learning myself a lot. I do help high school and undocumented students with their education but it’s more of assistance.  ','I have great respect for a friend a leader, Carolina Canizales, who I’m very different from but still admire. She is the type of leader who will come up with a plan herself and give assignments for people to execute it. Meanwhile I like to start a conversation with a group of people I’m working with put our heads together to solve the issue. ','In 2012, I was working in voting campaign to get the Latino Community out to vote in San Antonio. During one of our job trainings I was approached by someone who told me that I was too focused on the politics and not on the people. I had a conversation with them about how what we do should not be for a political party or politician. After that conversation I was more comfortable canvassing because I was not approaching the person trough them not an issue.','As I mention before one of the things that frustrates me is that undocumented students have to jump through hoops to enroll to college. Even though in-state tuition has been offer for more than10 years in Texas, college counselors still don’t know all the facts. Undocumented students have been discouraged from attending school because the right information there for them. I know that we will only move forward if this students are helped and educated.','I would make a computer program that will allow undocumented students to choose the school they want to attend and from there admission process will be ten times easier. The program will be able to deliver where they can apply, the documents they need and where to send all this information. It will also serve as a resource on what to do to get make the transition easier. ','One of my favorite apps is twitter, not only is a great communication app but if you can use it the right way, it\'s a search tool. When you search something on twitter it will give you the most random results, I think that we can use it to our advantages and be able to search a topic from certain dates. It will gives us the best result on a topic or news story that we want to know how it was developed.

I\'m now a more creative thinker and musician.','There’s a distribution problem in our country where tons of food go to waste (and ultimately landfills which release methane into the air), and millions are left hungry. Much of the waste occurs in households that store too much food and lets it go bad. Currently there’s no acceptable way to redistribute excess household food because those households are unaware of individuals either on the street or next door willing to accept such food.','If someone has food that won\'t be used before it goes bad, one can use an app to indicate the type, brand, and volume of food that will go to waste, and make it available for free or a set small fee to app users within walking distance. Or, app users can browse what\'s available around them and if one wants a particular food item, they can message whoever has that food and determine the exchange.','The Yelp app shows user reviews that are too unorganized to properly understand a restaurant. When asked to write a review, Yelp should have users specifically rate different aspects like quality of product, cleanliness, service, etc. quantitatively on a numerical scale and qualitatively with words.

','I am currently the Event Coordinator at Tibetan Aid Project; a non-profit organization dedicated to the social preservation of Tibet.

I\'ve always been very interested in becoming a master at coding, knowing that this skill will help me provide my community tools that can help increase their effectiveness in organizing. A solid coding course will build on the basic coding knowledge I have, providing me with the complete knowledge to concretize my ideas. Also, I hope to build relationships with the other trainees. ','My professional ambitions reside in the field of social justice. I plan to dedicate myself to grassroots advocacy organizing. In particular,  working to elevate the voice and political power of Latino and Immigrant communities. I look forward to the day when I can use my skills to develop, through the use of technology, ways to achieve a more equitable social atmosphere where Latino and immigrant communities have equal access to opportunities for growth. ','I grew up across the border from Ciudad Juarez, MX. The city is infamous for the disappearance and deaths of hundreds of women since the 1990s. When I was 10 I met Socorro, a witness to one of these murders. At the risk of her own life she alerted the authorities. The murderers got word of this and went after her, forcing her to flee. She stood up against the oppressors and the established norms of male dominance. Her act inspired me to do the same. ','I attended the most conservative university in America. In my freshman year, a priest told me to leave because my values did not conform with those of the university. I stood up to the oppressor despite of the implications that I might have lost my full scholarship and said no. I also sought to create an LGBTQ club on campus but was turned away. Socorro inspired me to do all this and so I want to create resources that allow others to do the same. ','I met Rashad Robinson in August of 2013. I admire the way he has contributed immensely to social justice issues in both the African-American and LGBTQ communities. We keep in touch, and I would ask him to mentor me because I am interested in the use of technology, communications, fundraising and organizing to advance a better world for marginalized communities.  \r\n','Currently, I am the staffer (outside of my executive director) with the most months of experience at my organization. I find myself often helping out my peers and answering their questions when it comes to mission centric and administrative issues. Being a nurturing person, I help them build their skills by I leading them to take on leadership roles by starting projects on their own. It\'s really rewarding when they realize what they are capable of. \r\n','I met Jorge Gutierrez, a leader of the Queer Undocumented Immigrant Project in Washington, DC at a United We Dream lobbying effort this past summer. His leadership was unique and admirable in that he was always charismatic, and took things to a laissez-faire approach yet was authoritative when needed. I differ in being a nurturing yet assertive leader, always prioritizing the team while also planning the best and most efficient way to achieve results.','I have been told by my superiors that I am too idealistic. An example: when organizing the annual fundraiser of Tibetan Aid Project I attempted to bring in a celebrity. I didn\'t realize how difficult it really is to make this happen and so I used a lot of time on this task that I could have used on more productive things. I took this criticism as a way to grow and improve my method in carrying out tasks--being more realistic. This is what made it great. \r\n','In the undocumented community, we experience a number of immigration raids every year. These usually entail ICE stopping traffic on certain intersections frequented by undocumented people, going to places where immigrants frequent, and even going to factories where they work. ICE asks them for documents to prove they\'re living legally in the United States. Sadly, many families are separated every day through deportation when people can\'t provide this. ','I want to create an app that people can use to alert others of raids in their communities. When raids occur, people send text messages to their loved ones and friends so they can avoid that area. If a larger network of people are connected to the application, more people could be alerted and hopefully less families would be separated. The app would also be connected to legal centers and human rights organizations that can go and help. \r\n','Snapchat, a photo messaging app, allows users to take photos and videos and add text or drawings that can then be sent to a number of users. These clips or photos auto-delete as soon as the recipient opens them. The benefits of snapchat could be expanded if we could have actual off-the record conversations that also auto-delete. This would help activists stay off the record to the government when attempting to organize civil disobedience acts. ','In a regular workweek, I get up at 7 am and meditate for 30 minutes to an hour. I work Monday-Saturdays from 9am-5pm. After work I go to the library and do whatever coding I have to do for the day. So far I\'ve learned HTML and CSS! On Wednesdays I take a class on Tibetan meditation. In summary, the three main things that consume my time are: work, coding, and meditation.

At the end of it all, he has become the face of our community knowing the struggle of our broken immigration system. One day, I would want him to sit me down and teach me how to be a leader.','Honestly. I mentor all the to-be leaders at Palm Beach State College. This is only my second year here and I was able to obtain the highest student leader position that you can achieve. When I sit with other student leaders, I tell them about my struggles and motivations. I tell them what our role is as leaders. Which is not to just lead others, but to also build other leaders. People need guidance and it is up to us to see them through it.	','One person I can think of is one of my closest mentors, Shona Castllo. She has taught me so much in my time at Palm Beach State and I truly admire her. However, our leadership is quite different. Where she is amazing at delegating and getting others to get there things together. Sometimes, I rather get it done myself because I feel that sometimes that I could get it down the right way the first time. Although, this is where I faultier.','The one thing that I hear a lot is that I am \"too sensitive.\" I have always pushed that idea away because I never took that statement seriously. One day after a meeting, a close friend of mine sat me down and told me that I take somethings to heart too much. I sat there and allowed the idea to marinate within me. I understood what she was telling me and told myself in order for me to grow as a leader, I must work on that part of me.','We as a community have just stopped caring. Caring for what is going on around us. Looking at the white youth especially. I work a lot with in my community and never see any other white youth helping out in our community. This is something that is important to fix because there is a strong sense of aggression towards the white population. It is not physically expressed, but you can emotionally feel the disconnection.','If there is anything to create, it would be a program that out reached to the white population that motivated them to step-up and be apart of what is going on in our community. This would be by receiving emotional messages of real stories of people hurting with in our own backyards. The point is not to guilt them, but to get them to understand the this so called \"struggle\" is very real and it needs all of us to work together to stop it.','I would like to improve the advertisements in our social media. (such as Facebook) A lot of the time it is too focused on informing us about the things that it thinks we want to hear. Instead it should inform us about the things we should hear about. Maybe Facebook should have some hub where is keeps all of our local news and important updates on what is going on as a nation. ','I spend most of my at Palm Beach State College doing work as an Interclub Council Chairman. In addition, I do a lot of work with in the movement of immigration. I have my own leadership position with in the movement and it is something that is very close to my heart. Finally, I have my family. At the end of the day, when ever I need people to talk to and cherish me, they are always there for me.','4','5','5','5','5','5','4','3','2','5','1','1',NULL,'None','None','None','None','None','None',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,'Right now, I am achieving my Asociates in Arts degree at Palm Beach State College.

Right now, I can understand French better than I can speak it.','I come from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota. I am multi-racial -- Native American and African American. My father was killed before I was born. Consequently I was raised by my mother, who supported four children alone on a teacher\'s salary. She is the Native Cultural teacher at a magnet school for Native students in the Twin Cities area in Minnesota. ','I work three jobs while attending continuing education courses at the School of Visual Arts. The primary source of my income comes from my work as a freelance photographer. I also serve as a photo and production assistant, as well as a cook at a restaurant to bring in extra money. Previously, I worked in DC on the business development team of an organizational development consulting firm specializing in diversity, inclusion, and cultural competency.','Native American communities across the continent are in the midsts of a cultural renaissance, as my generation works through the process of determining what it means to be Native today. Central to this movement is the use of technology, especially apps, websites, and social media to disseminate ideas, share culture, organize around issues, and bring Natives together. A Code for Progress training could help me powerfully engage in this important process. ','I regularly get notifications through progressive networks about organizations looking for programmers. I would use my training to leverage those opportunities while pursue continuing education courses related to web design and graphic design, since I believe the most effective sites merge form and function, and passion and purpose. I would then develop my own creative consulting firm for orgs working on progressive, Native, or social justice issues.  ','I have learned many of my most foundational lessons about justice from my mother and my grandparents. They taught me that justice is subjective, constantly evolving, and often difficult to determine. Nevertheless it is an ideal worth striving for, and that not only is the pursuit of justice honorable, but necessary. Through their actions they have shown me that justice requires both discipline and courage. ','I have dedicated my life to becoming an agent of social change. I have sought to use my talents and the privileges and opportunities afforded to me in the pursuit of justice. I have carefully honed my beliefs and values, and have envisioned a bold and ambitious path for me to leave my mark in the progress and development of my community.','Howard Ross, founder of Cook Ross Inc. Before beginning my career in photography I worked at Howard\'s consulting firm, which specialized in leadership and organizational development with a focus in diversity, inclusion, and cultural competency. I would ask Howard to mentor me because he is a skilled coach of leaders from various companies and sectors, and would be a good all-around mentor for whatever project I am working on. ','Other than my three younger siblings who are in high school and middle school, I am not actively engaged in a formal mentoring relationship with anyone. That isn\'t to say I don\'t often offer advice and assistance to people who asks for it, or haven\'t been a mentor in the past, but at the moment I am not actively participating in a formal mentorship opportunity. ','My leadership strengths lie in my ability to create bold and innovative visions for groups, generate buy-in to the idea, and inspire others to utilize their skills in the realization of the vision. I admire and work best with leaders who are excellent managers, capable of mapping out tangible steps and goals to the completion of a project, and keeping the team organized and on track. ','Some of the best constructive criticism I received was in my New Leaders Fellowship training at the Center for Progressive Leadership. I learned I didn\'t need to be all things to all people to be an effective leader, nor did I need to be perfect. This allowed me to make a more honest assessment of my strengths and weaknesses, and seek out partnerships that supported me, rather than try to do everything on my own. ','After centuries of physical and cultural genocide, my generation of indigenous people are determining what it means to be \"Native\" today, and what our place is in the societies that have been built around us. The reconfiguration of time and space that has resulted from innovations in communication technology have prompted many Natives to take on the issues facing our communities using the power of various online and social media platforms.','I am interested in creating programs that connect Native communities in ways that will help us leverage our political, economic, and cultural power. For instance, an app that educates Native people about political issues directly impacting Native Communities and provides tools to engage in the political process would empower us to organize and influence the issues that matter most to us. ','ontheissues.org and kickstarter.com serve important functions--the political education of citizens to help them make informed decisions about policies and politicians, and the redistribution of capital to support grassroots initiatives.

Our world is becoming increasingly saturated with technology. Although this technology might be used in a sometimes harmful manner-for example, American\'s phone records being stored without their permission-it can certainly be used to improve the quality of people\'s lives. I would love to create things that people can leverage to empower themselves and others.','I plan on working in a media outlet or organization.','My parents taught me justice, in the sense that they encouraged the idea that I should treat all people with the same level of respect and fairness. I think because my parents are immigrants (originally from Kenya) they constantly stressed never treating anyone like they were beneath me in any way because of difficulties they faced when they first moved to the United States.','Firstly, I always treat people around me respectfully. Additionally, the values of social justice and equality they instilled in me inspires me to plan for a career that somehow helps and empowers people in my community.','I took a class last semester called Development and Digital Networks, about how technology can be used to enable sustainable development in areas that lack strong governments. The professor of the course spent time mapping slums in Nairobi to help the people who lived there. I found him really inspiring, and I would definitely ask for his advice in the future.','I consider my younger sister, who is fifteen and a freshman in high school, as someone I\'m mentoring. I try and encourage her to take new opportunities and always reflect on and learn from her experiences, because I feel like that would have been advice that would have helped me when I was her age.','This past semester of college, I have been involved in the Roosevelt Institute chapter at my school, which a progressive student group that combines policy and activism. The president of our chapter certainly leads it in a different way than I would-she is very direct with her expectations. This has definitely helped us get things done-someone needs to take charge in order for a large group of people to focus and accomplish a lot, which we have.','My high school field hockey coach would tell me to always try and be 15 minutes earlier than I was expected to be somewhere. At the time, I thought that was unnecessary, but now I realize that being punctual lets people know that you value your time as much as theirs. It not only is a good habit because then I\'m never late, but is also respectful because no one has to wait around for me.','In low income areas, it is often difficult for people to get access to healthy and good quality food. This is commonly referred to as a \"food desert\". This leads to high obesity rates and other health problems for people who live in these areas.','If more data is available about food deserts, then it\'ll be easier to analyze the problem and try and find a solution. Mapping them and what they consist of (socioeconomic status and other population characteristics) is one way to approach it. A map could contain information about residents of the food deserts to learn more about what causes these areas.','I really enjoy using Tumblr because it allows people to connect with people who have similar ideas and interests. I think they should add a chat and group chat function. People often communicate by adding their own opinion to the end of a post they\'ve reblogged, but it might be more productive to exchange ideas through a messaging system.','1)School-I\'m working towards a degree in Political Communications, and studying and attending classes consumes most of my time.\r\n2)Extracurriculars/Internships-I\'ve spent a lot of time working with the Roosevelt Institute by working on policy memos and attending political events here in DC.

Often, her ignorance of historical context caused her to unintentionally speak and think like a racist. It shocked me that a person so “passionate” and “educated” about equity for low-income and students of color could be so implicitly and overtly bias against the very people she was \"advocating\" for.','I started mentoring/teaching middle school students through an after school program and inserting culturally relevant lessons into our current events curriculum.

','I admire their ability to inspire loyalty and mobilize a team to follow them without a plan, only a vision. Unlike my style of leadership, which inspires loyalty based on my ability to be organized and have a methodized plan, this leader focuses less on process and more on end goal. And, what inspires loyalty is their sometimes harsh results-oriented nature. Whereas my gentler nature focuses more on progress and less on results. ','I was recently told that my drive to get things done well and give 100% to everything, is sometimes a hindrance to efficiency and managing priorities. It was great constructive criticism because it called out the root of the problem not just the symptoms. Instead of just saying \"be more efficient\" or \"manage your priorities better\", it gave me a starting point at which to make change. Otherwise, I wouldn\'t know how to fix the problem. ','An issue creating barriers for organizations, particularly those without a lot of money and/or that serve underrepresented communities, is that there isn\'t a free and easy platform through which to have a storytelling, photo, or video campaign that isn\'t a popular social media network. Therefore, supporters often can\'t participate without their entire network knowing about it, and it\'s tedious for organizations to capture every story for their own record.','My computer program would allow people to create a widget for their own website that allows users to directly upload/capture a photo/video/audio/written story.

Empowerment & confidence came from knowing he had confidence in my core skills. His leadership also ensured that the project was successful by supporting the team with insights, advice, encouragement, along with pointing out needed improvements. He was patient and was a great teacher, and in a short time I was able to contribute new ideas. \r\n','I always think back to a professor who told me that “people will support something they have a hand in deciding. So when decision making occurs,  let them chose at least one of the following: who, what, how, when, or where”. Sometimes in leadership one feels we must have all the answers and make all the decision when in reality its not the case. A leader empowers and includes others.

In college I was constantly infuriated by the sexism and racism that happened on campus.

It is so difficult to talk about needs because no one wants to talk about the problem itself being that it is a heavy topic and it is easier to pretend it isn\'t real. There are folks that are trying to make this issue come to light and be addressed but in coalition we could do so much more. There needs to be an app with different event ideas and approaches to doing that work.','If there was an app as such, folks would be able to register and have an account where they could post the ways they have tried to address the issue along with what worked and what did not work.They would also be able to pinpoint spaces where sexual assault and rape have taken place anonymously compiling a map of what space where safe and unsafe depending on where you are. Finally, folks would be able to see a calendar of events surrounding the topic.','I think one app that could be improved is the google now widget. I love google now for letting me log my home and work and every now and then remembering when I work and when I should leave for work but it could be better.

This training will equip me with tools to go and teach others what I learned. I may not be able to teach them coding per se, but rather, I could provide a great resource to demonstrate that there are endless capabilities for people who are generally not present in the coding world.','After finishing the residency, I plan to continue my quest of joining an organization that teaches languages to at-risk youth.  At-risk youth are marginalized and have few, albeit strained, resources dedicated to teach/provide them with skills that the market will demand. Equally important, I want employment that uses innovation to satisfy market and social needs.','My grandmother taught me about justice. She taught herself Basic English because she knew that she would have to take a literacy test when registering to vote.  Despite blatant inequities of Mississippi, she made it a point to teach me to still be respectful, empathetic, and fair to everyone. To my amazement, in her advanced age, she went on to take care of the very same group of people that tried to thwart her attempt to register to vote.','In all my actions, I strive to be genuine and fair.  I make concerted efforts to remain positive about situations, and always look for the good in people. I recently moved to DC and found it initially difficult, because I didn’t have money or ‘connections’. However, if my grandmother could endure Mississippi, I should be able to weather DC.','I would ask my calculus professor to mentor me. She would be an ideal person to mentor me because she was a person who had changed her educational path from being political science (my major) to mathematics. I never thought that I would schedule myself to take a calculus course, but when I found out that her major was formerly political science, she demonstrated that there is no set in stone path for any one person to take. 	','I currently mentor first generation undergraduate students. I am a resource to help them build their personal and professional portfolio.  I help with job search, reading/revising resumes and cover letters, discovering ways to acquire new skills, pushing them to take STEM courses whenever possible, and ways to enjoy life.','I admire Cornel West\'s leadership. He is dogged and unapologetic about actions to end racial and marriage inequality. We are passionate about both issues, and envision a world of equality. Our approaches are different such that he focuses on moving the mental soul of America. I focus on building human capital and skills of those who are marginalized. In this way, good social change can be demanded rather than asked for.','Someone told me that I must strive to have more balance in my life. I was told this because I spent most of my time taking care of others, rather than myself. I heeded the advice and realized that I was able to have a greater impact on those around me when I reserved a little time for myself. I started applying this advice in other facets of my life, and have become more driven and productive than before.','One problem that my community faces is monolingualism. As someone who has studied abroad, I know how hard it will be for people to adequately enter an internationalizing job market.

','I recently completed a year-long Global Health Corps fellowship with HIPS (formerly \"Helping Individual Prostitutes Survive\") in Washington, DC as a Mobile Services Programs Assistant. Currently, I am working as the Usher Coordinator & Receptionist at the Shakespeare Theatre Company. I am eager and energized to return to my work in public health, particularly working to end stigma against gender, sexual, and racial minorities. ','I am a storyteller. In the past, I have used digital technologies to spread advocacy messages while lessening stigma against historically marginalized communities. While I have had success creating videos for YouTube and Tumblr, I would like to develop website drafting skills that would allow me to create more robust platforms to advocate for vulnerable populations. ','I have two aims: one is to continue my volunteer work in harm reduction (such as my work with HIPS), while the other is to enter a PhD program in Gender and Sexuality studies with a focus on the digital humanities. ','I learned a great deal from a HIPS volunteer named Giulianni. During my tenure working at HIPS, I was charged with facilitating our tri-annual volunteer training. Giulianni was a fellow volunteer committed to addressing issues of power and privilege within our volunteer base. He continually challenged the assumptions I was bringing to the table while opening up space for me to learn and grow. ','Together, Giulianni and I created a new power and privilege training for HIPS volunteers. We printed off a sheet of \"universal human needs\" (the list was two pages long) and had volunteers craft open-ended questions to get at one of these needs. We did this to challenge ourselves and volunteers to meet our clients as complex individuals, moving beyond questions related simply to sex work or drug use. ','Perhaps the most influential mentor I can imagine working with is Barbara Bush, CEO and co-founder of Global Health Corps. I have formed a relationship with Barbara during my time as a GHC fellow. We are now in the process of brainstorming ways for GHC alumni to stay connected with our international community, and this would be a wonderful way for me to stay engaged. ','As a team leader on the overnight HIPS van, I lead a team of three volunteers of various ages, backgrounds, and experience to ensure we are providing ethical, timely services for our clients. I often ask individuals to state one specific skill they would like to work on that evening, and how they best receive feedback when trying to reach their goal. I do my best to meet each volunteer where they\'re at and crafting my feedback around their individual style','I admire the leadership style of my former boss, Catherine Paquette. As the Mobile Services Programs manager at a small non-profit, Catherine must wear many hats and cater to the needs of 70+ volunteers. I envy her organization, her patience, and her ability to stay energized into the wee morning hours. While I use humor as a way to forge connects with those I mentor, Catherine remains one of the most humble and genuine leaders I know. ','As I mentioned earlier, I often use humor as a way to connect with people. At times, however, I can use humor as a shield. My former boss offered things for me to consider, rather than outright criticism: how can I use my humor as a tool to make others see my vulnerability as well as my strength? The most effective leaders I have come across expertly weave between sharing their expertise and vulnerability. It is a skill I continue to refine. ','The number of resources in DC for vulnerable populations is quite extensive; while on the HIPS van, the need to be aware of what referrals to provide clients is crucially important. As the van is often run by volunteers who only go on the van once a month, many feel anxiety surrounding their knowledge of these resources. How can we empower volunteers to feel confident about referrals and what is the best way for them to access such resources? ','I imagine a Yelp-style app that breaks down all direct-service resources in DC (and beyond) into a system that is easy to navigate and non-threatening for volunteers/clients. I imagine service providers could search for resources based on theme (health, employment, immigration), location (DC, NYC, San Francisco), or the identity of a client (trans-friendly). Users can also write reviews for services provided, encouraging accountability. ','One app that often frustrates me is the \"NextBus\" app for the DC bus system. While users have the option of seeing the route the bus takes on a map, there is no way to find directions to a bus stop if you are in an unfamiliar part of town. You have to copy the bus\' address, place it in a second app, and then search from there. If there were a way to streamline the process and do everything in one app, that would improve the app considerably. ','1.

We meet to talk about grant writing formats. Together we communicate remotely so I can show them how to use different apps and tools that will liberate their data more effectively. ','I truly admire the leadership of former Councilwoman Leticia Ozuna. During her term she was resilient, always learning from mistakes, and taught us all how to rise above issues. She was often critiqued by other politicians for her strong public non-political leadership. I thought that my leadership tackled tough issues by fostering large groups. From her I learned to lead by example, and not to be afraid people smarter than me.','I\'ve been told that professionally I\'m stuck inside my head. That I need to over share. Not doing so prevents people from seeing my warm personality. When I share my ideas with others more often, my pioneering spirit, and amusing characteristics inspires others. I\'m better when when I\'m not a leading as a loner.','People in my community are in need of information that is localized, updated, and resourceful. I believe that open data mapping tools could be used to improve our quality of life, keep communities informed about their policymakers, and connect us to empowering opportunities. An IT advocate said \"asking for help is often wrapped in shame.\" Developing tools that dismantles these fears is important.','I\'m very interested in working with others to create a social services and social justice Information & Referral (I&R) system to solve problems. This tool be accessible via an app, and through a web-based platform. It would connect people to services they need urgently, and it would also connect galvanized constituencies to progressive change networks.

In general, I have been trying to be involved with LGBT groups on my campus and elsewhere.','Someone I would ask to personally mentor me would be Elyzabeth Holdford who is the Executive Director at Equality Ohio. I never was able to directly work with her, so I think I could learn so much from her in terms of leadership and activism.','Someone that I am currently mentoring would be the new president of our Pride organization on Capital\'s campus. He is only a sophomore, and as result seems a bit overwhelmed. I have been a part of Pride the past four years, so I have been helping him plan and coordinate events, as well as with paperwork issues that he may be facing. I also just want to support him.','The previous president of our Pride organization had a much different approach than I did in terms of leadership styles. He was more dictatorial and would rather tell people what to do than listen to others. This is not necessarily a negative leadership, but he was rather good at accomplishing tasks in a timely and efficient manner. He was also able to accomplish any visions he had in mind.','An excellent piece of criticism that I have received has been to not let others define your ideas or shoot them down so easily. The reason this advice resonates with me is because, prior to college, I would second guess my leadership skills, or my ideas. I have grown to realize that no idea should not go unnoticed and those ideas, when brought together, can truly transform an organization or people.','A problem that is currently affecting people in my community is health care, especially with regards to the older generation of LGBT citizens in the United States.

','In Gen Silent, several community members unite to assist the older LGBT members by taking them to appointments or acting as in house caregivers. I think it would be incredible, if at a local level, our community in Ohio could unite to do the same. I think those who need assistance could sign up through an app or program, and include the needs they have.

She embedded in my mind to treat every person equally. When I was dealing with being Gay she instinctively knew and insinuated that it did not matter.

The majority in our community go into medicine, engineering or business. While many do go into IT, very few of them are also involved in social and political activism.

My thesis and much of my previous work has focused on cyber-security, and I want an opportunity to try and be around that process as Congress goes through the process of trying to resolve privacy concerns with this issue. ','The biggest problem the Muslim community faces right now is a lack of accurate numbers on their political views outside of Middle East issues. Getting training in how to code would enable me to develop web applications that can be used to engage our community, find out what their views are, and then use that to help them develop solutions  to their problems.','I would want to work in a role that lets me develop advanced polling metrics and web applications that can be used for polling. Data analytics has become the new way of gathering usable data (as opposed to, say, surveys), and I want to use that wealth of data to help create engagement on political issues from groups that are traditionally not as politically involved - most specifically younger demographics.','My grandfather was a physician in Pakistan. He followed a simple code: first, to be honest; and second, that when helping those in need, that it should be done quietly. He felt that dishonesty was a form of injustice that harmed others ability to rise beyond their level., He felt that assistance should be silent because if it was done publicly, it could become inauthentic and cause others to be judged for receiving assistance. ','I was taught that honesty in work was doing the maximum while not promising the impossible. In academics, and work, I set goals with my supervisors and then found ways to increase my performance. When working in survey research, I pushed myself to achieve higher completion rates, and to understand the survey better so that I could better explain it. Second, I tended to try and limit awareness of my charitable activities to those involved in them. ','Darren Elliott was my first boss after college (for a short time.) He would be a good mentor because he not only inspires people to achieve, but he also goes out of his way to provide assistance to those in need. As the debate coach at a community college, he works with many students who have academic and financial problems. He takes those students and coaches them to consistently win debates, to the point where they win national titles. ','Shan is a debater at my high school who lacks confidence in himself because he has struggled competitively and socially to fit in with his team and at school. I\'ve done three things. First, I\'ve taken the time out to make sure he gets steady coaching from me so that he can improve. Second, I\'ve encouraged him to take pride in the victories he has had recently and to build upon those. Third, I have encouraged me to come to me with his problems. ','When I lead people, I do so from behind the scenes. I organize and facilitate the means for my group to get things accomplished. I ensure communication between members of the group and other leaders in it.  My friend David is different - he pushes others to do what he thinks is the most effective course of action, and to do it quickly. I admire this sort of leadership because it produces the most dramatic results and benefits a large number of people.','I was once told that I over-complicate my problem-solving strategies and by adding a myriad of details. I was told to simplify my choices by figuring out the core of the problem I was trying to solve and then isolating how each potential solution could resolve that problem. I appreciated this advice because of its broad applicability - the advice was helpful when resolving complex debate arguments, writing Ruby scripts, and when making life choices.\r\n','When I talk to members of my community about voting, one common complaint is that they\'re not sure what all the different ballot initiatives are and what all of the candidates support. At the state and local level, many constituents don\'t know what the candidates want to do. There needs to be some way to collect information about candidates in state and local elections, and then help voters make informed decisions about whom to vote for.','I would create a database that collects information from the Federal Election Commission and state departments of elections, and then allows users of an app or computer program to input information about candidates running for office in their area (including sources for verification.) This app could set itself apart by asking the user a series of questions about their political views to help them guide their choices when voting. ','I use a phone that runs Android Jelly Bean, and I find the biggest problem I face with it is that it routinely slows down, crashes, or stalls when navigating from one app to the next. Or, it may search for a better signal for an infinite amount of time. These problems drain the battery, and so I\'d improve the system by creating a timeout - if the phone does not move significantly for a period of time, it would shut down these processes to conserve battery.','I spent a lot of time doing working on my thesis (it\'s an examination of how we can protect privacy rights in a world where the government demands more information to protect us from cyberthreats.)

We helped run campaigns, we work great at building teams and motivating volunteers, but any and almost all things having to do with technology were being handled by men. The training I would receive, if accepted, would definitely open new doors for me and help me to understand and help put together the core of the work that goes into building grassroots campaigns.','I hope to continue searching for a position that allows me to help recruit, train and campaign for Democratic women that are running for public office. In my home state of New Jersey, only a total of five women have been sent to the U.S. House of Representatives, the last serving in 2003, and no woman here has ever been sent to Senate. It’s disappointing and illustrates how great of a need there is to prepare and identify prospective women candidates.   ','Although there are many great leaders that have influenced me, I would definitely have to say the concept of justice was first taught to me at home. At a very young age I remember my mother explaining to me how very few opportunities were available to her as a young girl growing up in Haiti and how things were not much different here in the US. She taught me to want and go after more because I was entitled to it and to motivate others to do the same.      ','I have made sure to just take advantage of every opportunity presented to me. All opportunities, little or small, are experiences might have not available to my mother so I always just keep that in mind. I have also just made sure to share with other young women what I have learned and to motivate them to go after more. This is a large part of why I want to help elect more women into office. Girls seeing more woman in these positions will motivate them.  ','Rep. Alisha Morgan, youngest female and first African-American to represent Cobb County in Georgia, and Councilwoman Charnette Frederic, first Haitian-American Councilwoman in Essex County, are two women that I would be honored to have as mentors. Although I have only had the privilege of meeting Ms. Frederic, I believe both women have broken so many barriers in very little time and serve as great examples of what I hope to accomplish in the future. ','I currently mentor a girl called Rahkell. I actually started working with her through Big Brothers Big Sister with Monmouth University about 2 years ago, but after graduating, I made sure to keep in touch. Because I am no longer in New Jersey, I do not get to see her, but I check in with her about every other week just to see how her first semester of college is going and to just remind her that I am still available to help and support her.','I volunteer a lot in Haiti with an organization called the Haitian-American Caucus. Samuel, Director of the compound where I volunteer, has been doing a great job of leading the organizations efforts there and keeping workers and volunteers involved. I am more of a person that likes to assign roles and address issues that may arise as a group, but he does the complete opposite and things still work. I see now that sometimes leading like that was necessary.','I recently was told by an interviewer for a position I was being considered for that I downplay myself too much and that many of the skills she believed I possessed when calling me in for an interview, I basically told her that I did not have. She helped me to realize that skills that were gained outside of paid-positions were just as important as those gained on the job and that I needed to learn how to market those skills to prospective employers. ','I found that a lot of people want to volunteer with organizations and on campaigns, but just are not able to make commitments ahead of time. A lot of the people that helped me on the last campaign were people that I called last minute. There are many volunteer apps, but I think there needs to be a way for people to sign up using an app to volunteer right at that moment/same day before they lose interest or are no longer able to.','The app would let organizations with volunteer opportunities list them on the app with all the information (time, locations, number of people needed) and would allow app user to sign up for volunteer events happening on that day. It would also let them to check in for all to see and keep track of the organizations they volunteered with and accumulate hours, maybe also even having them set hourly goals for the month to serve as motivation.','One app that I have always had a problem with was the Find My iPhone/iPad app that comes with apple devices. I had someone steal my iPad before and the first thing I did was run to my iPhone to locate the missing item using the app, but because the device was turned off, it could not be tracked and even when it turned back on, it was still untraceable because it was connected to 3g and not a WiFi. These flaws need to be improved. ','At the moment, I spend most of my time applying for jobs, internships and programs that help me gain the skills necessary to get a job. I also spend a lot of time doing work for the organizations I volunteer with. Even though I am no longer in NJ, I am still very hands on with the work that they are doing back home and help in any way that I can.

For instance, if I could build an application that helps wage workers to organize more effectively, voters to be more informed of their rights, or helps women find a place to access to vital healthcare, that would be amazing and something that I cannot presently do. ','I plan to look for work at a grassroots organization, or at least one with a grassroots component. I would prefer a multi-issue organization addressing several of the issues that I care about, such a worker/union organizing, voting rights, and reproductive health care rights. ','Samuel Lloyd was the Dean of the National Cathedral until 2012. From one of his sermon\'s I learned that forgiving is a necessary component of justice. Forgiving someone does not mean that you are a pushover, that the wrong they committed against you is okay, or that there should not be restitution for those wrongs. Rather, it allows those who have been wronged to not be bitter and to learn to move on with their lives. ','This is not an easy process to put into practice. It requires patience, fortitude, and prayer to change your frame of mind. This is what I did and had to do to begin to forgive people in my family who I felt had deserted me. It also helps to keep learning from others who chose to forgive rather than hate, such as Trayvon Martin\'s family is in the process of doing. ','I would ask Debra Cleaver because I admire that she started her own non-profit organization, Long Distance Voter, to assist absentee voters. She has also held several tech oriented jobs and could probably help me to navigate being a woman in a tech job, as well as  connect me to women and men in similar jobs in her network. ','I am not currently in a formal mentoring relationship with anyone. However I do belong to WIN(Women\'s Information Network) an organization that was founded so that women can draw upon one another for professional development and support. I have been in two leadership positions, first as a co-chair of the women\'s health policy network, and now as an ambassador. In these positions I have helped to create various networking opportunities for members. \r\n','I would say that my leadership style is democratic. I have only been in leadership positions in small groups, so I like to hear everyone\'s thoughts and try to find a consensus.  People whose  leadership I admire but whose style is different from mine include Michelle Obama who inspires passion through her own charismatic personality or Pope Francis who is more of a servant leader, inspiring others through his own actions.','Everyone at my current job recently had to do media training, during which we were critiqued on our off the cuff \"radio\" interviews. I was told that I gave off good energy, but that smiling would further engage my physiology as well as that of the listener.

Over the last 10-15 years D.C. has seen large population growth and uneven revitalization efforts. We must address the high unemployment rate, which are due in part to a lack of work opportunities. If not, inequality will remain high, and I believe we all benefit from raising everyone up.','The app would help unemployed people or those who operate in the informal economy by connecting them to other locals who need their skills (a plumber, mechanic, nail artist). It would also connect residents of wards 7 and 8 who want to open a business in the neighborhood with   pro-bono services in DC  (i.e. financial services, how to write a business plan a lawyer to look over a lease, a company that wants to offer free food for the opening of a salon).\r\n','I have had a Yahoo! account since the 1990s and never found much fault with it.

I particularly think that the ability to write code will enable me to reach out to many more people by learning how to build effective web pages. Additionally, the capacity to create computer applications will make it possible for me to organize and understand data more effectively. ','I would like to work for a non-profit or political organization in a role that involves database management. I feel that databases can be valuable resources when they are well-designed for the purpose for which you want to use them.','I had a classmate who taught me to look at everything through a lens of social justice. Our frequent conversations about course material, happenings on campus and the news trained me to consider what systems were influencing each situation and whether it was just. I learned that social justice is about understanding that political, economic, and cultural systems themselves need to be examined and critiqued, not just the way that people function in them.','I have better discussions with people in my community about politics. As a field organizer, I talked to many voters who denigrated those who receive public assistance. I tried to help them see the ways that our economy and social norms create a system that benefits some while disadvantaging others. This approach helps people to see inequality where they otherwise would have relied on their own frame of reference for fairness. ','I could benefit from the guidance of a former classmate of mine who is an activist in the biking and cycling community of Philadelphia. I admire her passion for her cause and the success she has achieved in her community in such a short time. She has written articles for different news sites on the subject and leads trainings to encourage people to take up biking. She is effective at recognizing problems in her community and setting out to fix them.','I’ve been a mentor to some of my teammates on my college track team, particularly those who want to become leaders. Generally, I listen and commiserate, letting them know that I\'ve faced the same problems. I have found that it helps to give specific examples of what I have done to address similar situations in the past. Also, I am always genuinely interested and encouraging.\r\n\r\n','I lead by example; I hold myself to a high standard and expect others to do the same. It’s effective when someone is motivated to work hard but not if she doesn’t want to put in the effort for herself. Because of that, I admire leaders who expect their team to perform highly, whether or not those individuals expect it of themselves. These leaders are often able to get results from the unwilling through inspiration and a different kind of expectation.','The best piece of constructive criticism that I’ve received is to add my opinions and perspective to discussions in which I should be involved. A professor gave me this advice in college and he framed it in a way that didn’t make me feel like I should speak up just because that’s what I’m supposed to do in class, but because I had valuable ideas to add.','From my time volunteering and managing volunteers, I believe that organizations in my community could benefit from having more robust volunteer programs that focus on recruiting and keeping volunteers. They could use help from volunteers to grow their organization by generating interest and investment, which would allow them to do more in their communities. The problem is that they may not have the resources to start or maintain such a program. ','I would develop an app that tracks an organization’s volunteer needs and a volunteer’s accomplishments to help make them more effective. I envision a program in which an organization could track a work variable. It could send emails to the volunteer after each shift detailing what she accomplished that day and overall for the organization. It would also allow organizations to post their needs, schedules and send email reminders. ','I would really love if the Vermont Public Radio app that I use had a sleep timer so I could listen to the current episode of Radiolab or the Moth Radio Hour as I drift off to sleep without worrying about it playing all night.','1) Campaigns and elections.

My nonprofit is a public advocacy group that works primarily on issues dealing with voter rights and money and politics.  The organization however, is monochromatic, with the demographics of the membership, staff and board being overwhelmingly white and over the age of 65.  The need for creative online tools to connect with a broader membership is crucial and far past due. ','Currently the organization I work for has an issue connecting with a large portion of citizens, specifically those who are not older, middle class and white.  In recent years some funds have been dedicate to doing outreach for underrepresented groups, however much of this funding is not invested in connecting people technologically.  Currently I do not have the skills needed to develop the necessary programs for connecting with a broad spectrum of people. ','I plan to look for employment with an organization that has a strong record of or desire to connect with and engage with a broad demographic of citizens.  I would like to design tools, sites and media strategies to do comprehensive, inclusive, authentic outreach.  This may be in the form of a creative nonprofit group or a for profit group that engages in philanthropy.  ','One person who taught me about justice was Rep. Alma Adams of North Carolina\'s House of Representatives.  Rep Adams\' fight was raising  the minimum wage and therefore advancing economic justice for the working poor.  This was a 10 year fight, but her diligence, patience and will to be a voice for people in need finally yielded a minimum wage increase in 2006.  I learned how worthwhile it is to be persistent & passionate in the pursuit of justice for all.','Since my legislative internship in 2006 I have dedicated my career to organizations working for the common good.  Since I graduated in 2008, I have worked for several organizations advocating for voting equality, civic engagement and education.  Usually reaching out to students and young adults, I have had to continuously figure out new ways to connect with ever-changing generational demographics, which takes a lot of patience, planning and persistence. ','I would ask my close friend and former colleague Conen Moran to mentor me.  His story, from being nearly homeless and jobless in the middle of his college career, to being a student leader, graduate, and then essential campaign and technological consultant in North Carolina, is truly inspiring. Always resourceful and entrepreneurial, he has always worked hard at establishing connections in the community through technology and networking.','Currently I am mentoring a colleague of mine in North Carolina, who was a student leader while I was working in the state.  Masaac Dorlouis, a graduate of St. Augustines College, currently works in my old position as a campus outreach coordinator.  I mostly mentor on how to engage students in the community and on campus as well as ways to connect other nonprofit groups with the African American Community.  ','I admire the leadership of Keith Ellison, US House Representative from Minnesota.  His leadership is fearless and he is compelled to speak out against the injustices that plague our society.  His leadership is very extroverted, giving moving speeches and participating in important protests.   My leadership style is more introverted, in that I like to speak out via writing, social media tools and with one on one conversations with potential participants. ','As an introvert I am often advised to speak out more and to advocate more aggressively for what I think and believe.  This is good advice for me because I am more comfortable working behind the scenes, however would seldom see any of my ideas or projects come to fruition.  Speaking up about my passions and ideas has often added a unique perspective to conversations and planning, which has been beneficial for my outreach work. ','In my community & within my organization people have issues connecting when they want to solve a specific problem.  They don\'t know who else cares about the problem, or which organizations or individuals may have started work already.  Because of this many end up \"reinventing the wheel,\" & wasting resources doing something that has already been done, just because they are unaware.

I have been lucky enough to learn and teach from diverse communities (age, gender, sexuality, culture, class, race).  When I decided to learn how to code and incorporate computer engineering and programming into my work as a dj and artist, I started to go to meet-ups.  I am often the one of 5 people of color or less in the room.  I am often one of 5 women or less in the room. ','I have spent the last 3 years as a contractor/hustler.  For the past year, I have been working with a DC based artist on a series of audio portraits for a gallery exhibit.  The exhibit will premier on June 14 for 2 months at American University.  I also work at a bakery in the early mornings during the week.  I am contracted with a research firm based in Annapolis.  And just finished organizing a market for the Mount Pleasant Business Association.','I want to understand the technology that impacts and shapes my life and the communities around me. I spend time on social media. I use a computer on a daily basis whether it’s my smartphone or my laptop.  I want to understand how these tools work.  And that basic understanding will allow me to learn how to build websites, code for music programming, databases, etc.  ','I want to be part of this program to help me answer that question.  I do know that I want my future employment to focus on interactivity whether it is incorporating that in building websites or code for applications.  Since I\'ve spent most of my working life as a storyteller and documentarian, I think that learning tools to visualize data would add another dimension to that.  I also want to incorporate uses of technology in live events.','My mother arrived in the U.S. from Kenya in her late 20s.  Worked 50 hours+ per week at several jobs caring for other people.  Meeting our basic needs meant that she couldn\'t spend time with us, it meant that she displaced her anger on us.  She worked with little possibility of moving ahead.  She was treated badly by racist clients, rarely given a promotion, or a raise; often, because those promotions and raises would go to her white U.S. born co-workers. ','I learned if justice is a mix of equality, fairness, and for some hard work—why did my mother fail to get the fruits of living in the states.  And the one way that I could explore what justice looked like and the lack of it for my communities was through the media.  That\'s how I got into reporting.  I knew that my mother\'s stories and others like her were not being told.  Instead the narrative was \"immigrants taking our jobs\" \"black people are lazy\" etc.  ','I treasure the grassroots experience of Ruby Corado – a DC based Transgender rights organizer. She started Casa Ruby—a resource center and transitional housing unit that serves the Latino LGBT community.  They have limited financial resources but are innovative in their approach towards grounded ways for community needs assessments.\r\n\r\nDiana Nucera from the Allied Media Projects is amazing to connect with around her thoughts on healthy digital ecologies.  ','I am not actively mentoring anyone.   I still maintain relationships with my students that I taught while I was an educator for Radio Rootz.  I try to support them financially when they produce work or I make sure to attend their shows.  I also try to make myself available to them if they have questions or need to be connected to resources.   ','One of my favorite people, Darby Hickey, happens to be an amazing facilitator and the folks that I connect to the most as leaders are facilitators.  We both are similar in the sense that we don’t talk for the sake of talking.  But unlike me, she\'s blunt.  And I love that about her.  People respond well because she doesn’t use it to crush your opinion or belittle you.  She is frank and honest while making you feel heard. ','Self-care is important in order to sustain work that you are passionate about.  \r\n\r\nI used to say “yes” to everything.  And meet everyone where their needs are without acknowledging my own.  This translated into many parts of my life.  I would spend hours outside of the classroom and my designated planning period to work with students.  In other projects, I’d take on extra work, spend extra time in field or in the studio to meet unrealistic deadlines. \r\n','Two years ago, I was on food stamps. It was hard for me to easily access a list of places near me that sold produce and accepted food stamps if I was not near my home.  Luckily, I live near two grocery stores but I could imagine what it\'s like for a large quantity of people in DC who do not have that luxury.  Also, some convenient stores have limited produce if any so that makes it difficult to find healthy and affordable options while on food stamps.','I would create an app that would allow easy access to a list of stores near a Snap recipient that accept food stamps.  That app would also include whether those store sells produce and/or meat.  It would also include a user/comments feature for customers that owners could use to decide what to order based on customers interests.  And maybe another feature could include some kind of recipe tool.','After the Target pin code thefts, I asked my credit union if it had an optional alert system for times when $100 or more was charged to my account.  I would want them to automatically text me because I look at my bank account statement on-line once a month.  They don\'t.  But it definitely made me think of all the ways my financial safety is threatened and then led me to think of all of these other ways in life that we are not secure.','DJaying:  I tell stories through the music that I facilitate on the dancefloor.

With much of my family living in Israel, the topic of oppression and marginalization is not foreign to me. ','I currently have a seasonal cashier job at Target to make a little money before I start the Spring semester at CC. I have also been a Residential Advisor at CC, fall 2012. They both involved being \"fast, fun, and friendly\" as they say at Target, and being on good terms with co-workers or fellow \"team members.\" However, obviously the RA position was more involved, demanding, and personal, which I enjoyed. Both also involved mundane tasks that I do not miss.','I\'ll be able to crystallize worthy causes--that is, make them visible and even attractive in a manner appropriate to today\'s society of mobile apps and social networks. Computer knowledge is a multifaceted tool I can wield at my college to fight towards efficient and effective informational events. Also it will give me the more general information, connections, and support necessary to be an effective leader of any social justice movements. ','I plan to finish my LAS degree in Psychology at Colorado College, after which I plan to travel to Israel and pursue a doctorate degree. I hope to explore non-profit organizations for social justice in Israel/Palestine. In such a technologically centered culture I believe those algorithmic skills will be handy if not imperative to creating effective social justice movements by engaging the upper middle class millennials. ','Last October I met a man who introduced himself to me as Sir Daswell in Washington Square in Manhattan, New York. He makes art and is always traveling, and knows just about everything. He told me stories of him and his friends being stopped and frisked, and showed me the representative art he made about it. He described systematic injustice, and I learned that with my privileges and luck I have a real chance to effect real change. ','Since returning to college I have sought to take advantage of opportunities to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to be an effective leader and voice for justice. I have signed up for events such as the Colorado Student Power Convergence, and internships to learn about sustainable development of third world countries. I engage in serious conversations with my fellow mainly 1% Liberal Art School peers. ','I would actually ask Heidi Lewis to be my mentor, though she is so busy fighting the good fight I doubt she\'d have time. She\'s a Feminist and Gender Studies professor whose focus is racial marginalization. Heidi lectures everywhere, participates in blogs and proactive feminist websites, as well as teaches. I would love to learn from her how to time manage and some practical tips on how to appropriately discuss social justice.','My younger sisters are for whom I\'m any sort of \"mentor.\" We\'re friends and joke a lot, but I also am honest and serious with them. I encourage them to ask questions and explain thoughts and subjects that come up. I offer many angles when we discuss any event or person. My youngest sister and I play piano, and I teach her theory to help her write her own songs. Mostly, I try to be a role model of compassion and grace, unafraid to admit when I\'m wrong.','My boss when I was a Residential Adviser was invested in creating a \"cool\" and joke-filled work environment for the RAs in our building. He also had methods of reward and punishment to get us to form habits to do with filling out paperwork and such. He was a very effective team leader. When I lead, I generally don\'t have strategies for manipulating people into doing what is needed; rather I try to talk straight and trust their ability and practical minds. ','I was told multiple times to reconsider before I apologize for something. This was because, like many other insecure people, I would overuse the word \"sorry.\" Not an uncommon problem, but it was astonishing how differently I saw myself just when I subtracted that self-resigning word from my minute-to-minute vocabulary. I saw myself as more competent--and thus became so. I no longer felt crushed by my sense of responsibility, rather as capable of it.','At my college we do not have one place we can look to see all of the events happening on campus. We have posters, bulletin boards, \"listserv\" emails, and people\'s Facebook statuses which are neither thorough nor efficient due to the absent and repeated events. People cannot conveniently check any place for the events they would otherwise be happy to participate in. ','I would create an app which lists all events. It would be listed on the main page in chronological order. The events would be listed BY the users, also. There would be a space to include date, time, and a description. Users could also look up specific types of events by category (music, networking, environment, politics, etc). Finally, the users choose the events they would like to attend, and their chosen events appear in another consolidated list. ','I think it would be cool to have Facebook be the ultimate home on the computer. That is for Google and Facebook to consolidate powers, and for all websites to have direct links to it. A search could include everything from your friends\' new boyfriend to the latest headline news to international couchsurf options. And of course your email could be facebook available, though on a page separate from the more exciting and personal facebook \"messages.\"','1. people I deeply care about (close friends, family)\r\n2. music\r\n3. academics','5','5','5','4','5','4','5','4','1','4','4','2',NULL,'None','None','None','None','None','None','Heidi ','Lewis','heidi.lewis@coloradocollege.edu','(719) 389-6909','Heidi taught a course I took at Colorado College called Introduction to Feminist Thought.

','A polling app that not only gives the user accurate  raw information on what’s going on with  Congress but an app that gives  several ideas/choices as to what the people think is the best way to solve the immediate problem.

This city has been historically excluded on many levels; and presently, our public school situation is deplorable, notwithstanding the outrageous crime statistics.\r\n\r\nI am currently active and involved in community organizations such as, Newark Anti-Violence Coalition; FP YouthOutCry Community Empowerment; and Newark Mentor Movement.\r\n','No, I am not currently working nor a caretaker.','The training will serve as a tool that will help and allow me to better serve my community. Because of the vast advancement in technology today, I would like to equip myself with as much information and knowledge as I can absorb. Completing this program, would be an accomplishment which can help me be a better mentor and community activist. The structure of the Code for Progress is a great mechanism to launch new ideas and collaborations.','Because my professional employment background is in higher education and educational non-profits, I would like to secure a position within the community school district(s) to administer a two-fold program (1)to increase retention; and (2) assist with college preparation and enrollment.','Rev. Al Sharpton - I am a past vice-president and president of the National Action Network - Atlanta Chapter. Serving the community in a leadership capacity taught me that through all struggle and situations, justice is obtainable. The NAN Crisis Committee was a very important dynamic in the chapter. The community invited and depended upon NAN to assist and resolve their issues to achieve justice; many of them were successful.','I have remained engaged and active in the plight to help rid injustices and to bring awareness to the community about violence. I have stood on the front-lines in marches; I have stood in bitter cold and excruciating heat advocating to stop the violence; I have attended NAN National Conferences; met with various community and political leaders; supported political candidates that share my values.','Honestly, I would love to have Queen Latifah mentor me. Why? Because she is a Newark native who understands our struggle but more importantly, she has risen to heights beyond imagination. Her business acumen is phenomenal. She is an excellent example and demonstration of how our youth can overcome their personal challenges and accomplish positive, productive and reachable dreams. I absolutely love her and yes, I would ask her.','I have just recently been accepted into the Newark Mentoring Movement; Project RISE will begin January 2014. However, I have prior experience as mentor with the Clayton County School District (GA), I was very proud to be able to help a young lady named Angel throughout her matriculation and beyond. The bond we formed still exists today. ','I wholeheartedly admire President Barack Obama. The one difference in leadership styles is he is much more diplomatic and cautious. I admire his effective articulation. His control and delivery when speaking is captivating. The only thing that is different, but can be enhanced is that I have yet to achieve his level of articulation and delivery...but I will...','The best constructive criticism that I have been given was to face myself in the mirror. It was good advice because it was true; and I still do it daily.','Guns, violence, murder and death. Newark does not have a hub where resources can be collected and shared. The community family is grief stricken; they (we) need to have an information center that will help families identify resources for funeral costs and grief counseling; other than churches. What happens after the death is as important as the death. This problem has many components but educating our youth to stop shooting is primary. ','I envision a system that would allow family victims share their experience(s) and offer information and contacts for the purpose of keeping them connected, uniting them to come together while educating our youth about the importance of self-love and not self-destruction; the importance of not submitting to street violence. Resources are just that resourceful. We need a program in place where people could input and research how to stay connected afterwards.','I use Facebook often as a tool to learn about current events and what is happening in the city.

','During the summer, I was employed by Critical Exposure through the SYEP program to co-facilitate workshops about oppression and photography to other youth. My co-facilitator, Fatimah Martin, a Critical Exposure staff member, taught me that, in order to educate people, and ourselves, about injustices/oppression, difficult conversations have to be had.','I\'ve become more open to sharing about my experiences and less judgmental towards others for thinking and behaving in certain ways. I\'m less likely to shut someone down and am more open-minded when someone has an ideal I disagree with.','I would ask a woman named Falon Shackelford, she works for an environmental justice organization and is very knowledgeable about how climate change creates hardships for people across the world. She is also very critical about organizations/people/etc. and critical thinking is a skill I\'m trying very hard to develop. ','I am mentoring someone in another youth program I participate in, it\'s called City at Peace. There is a young Black women in the program who is having a difficult time dealing with the people at her high school saying and doing things that trigger her. I talk with her about her experiences and direct her towards resources that are hopefully bringing her some clarity about what she\'s going through.','I admire the leadership style of a friend from Critical Exposure. She has a very determined way of doing things which motivates the people around her to spring into action as well. I perceive my own leadership style as being more mellow and inclusive but people are less inclined to work as hard if I were to be as intense as my friend.','After facilitating a workshop with a friend, he encouraged me to more actively engage the participants, who were high school students, by joking around with them and being more lively. I felt like this was good criticism because I want my workshop participants to have as much fun as they are gaining knowledge, I wouldn\'t want the participants to walk away from my workshops feeling as if they need a nap. ','Re-certifying for SNAP benefits seems to be a really stressful experience for many people in my community. People have to take time off of work, find childcare, travel across the city depending on where they live, and spend a substantial amount of time in a high-stress environment to receive their SNAP benefits. Creating a more efficient system for people to receive SNAP benefits would greatly decrease the stress people experience for meeting their needs.','I would create a secure webpage that would allow people to input their information into the government\'s system remotely. That way, they would receive their SNAP benefits without having to re-arrange their schedules. ','If my bank were able to send me a text giving me my balance information after I make a card purchase, that would help me be more mindful about my money and spending habits.','Critical Exposure, a youth organization that gives young people the power of photography to share our stories and strengthen our social justice campaigns.

It is problem that families are being separated unfairly when this nation upholds family as the sole unit and base of society.

By merely being conscious of our history, we will gain a deeper understanding of our society and of ourselves, enabling us to become our own agents of change should it be necessary.  ','I admire the adamant and nonsensical way avid activists of ethnic minorities fight for representation and acceptance by mainstream society. Sometimes their strong point of view and argument can be interpreted as being \"too sensitive\" and overbearing, especially against charges of racism, but I admire that they are steadfast in their beliefs and refuse to accept anything less than what they know their fights are worth. ','That I should not despair and get \"burn out\". I tend to over-think things and get overwhelmed and discouraged, which is why it was recommended to me to learn to relax more and pursue what brings me joy. That way, I will not get \"burn out\" and will have the stamina to withstand long and daunting processes.  ','The lack of strong non-profits serving the Vietnamese American throughout the U.S. There should be more prominent organizations dedicated to the empowerment and needs of the Vietnamese American community nation-wide. As the older generation numbers dwindle away, children of low-income refugees and immigrants within this community need a helping hand to prepare them for the shaky future ahead. This will require resources, and resources we should get.','The program, or app, should provide young Vietnamese American a comprehensive listing of all the currently available organizations with resources to helping the Vietnamese American community on a local, state-wide, and national level. By having such an accessible listing ready at their fingertips, they will be able to find the help they need to navigate the society which their parents were unable to, may it be due to the language barrier or other factors.','One of my favorite app is the Yelp app. Although it\'s convenient, it\'s limited at times due to the nature of long-winded reviews. When you\'re really hungry, you really don\'t want to scroll through hundreds of reviews to find the best tasting dish, or the best rated dish at any given restaurant. While their \"Tips\" section exist, it\'s generally useless to me. If they could pinpoint the most popular or recommended dish from the get go, that would be great.','One of the way I retain my curiosity and up-to-date-ness is by frequenting memes.

','I admire the leadership style of Gene Demby, head blogger for NPR\'s Code Switch blog and also the founder of group blog that I write for, PostBourgie.com. He is very open to new ideas and willing to allow everyone in the group to generate and run with whatever content we think would be interesting to readers. His style is different than mine in that he is very hands-off, whereas I like to pulse check with my team a bit more just to ensure timeliness.','The best piece of constructive criticism I\'ve received is that I should be more bold and confident about my skills and accomplishments. I used to be very concerned with how I was perceived because I didn\'t want to be seen as overbearing or pushy. However, I have learned that being appropriately confident in my skill set is an important part of advancing my career. It also is necessary if I want to share my knowledge with others. ','The Word Gap (poor children about 30 million fewer words by age 3) is an issue that affects how well poor children perform in school, which impacts the trajectory of their entire lives (school performance, life outcomes). By addressing the word gap early and through use of accessible technology, poor children may have a chance at achieving better outcomes. ','Currently the Thirty Million Word Initiative (tmw.org) has a curriculum and LENA pedometer that measures the how many words a child in their program is using. I\'d like to create an app that allows parents mobile access to the TMW Initiative platform. It would work in a similar fashion to DuoLingo, providing fun game-based word activities that parents could play with their children, as well as allow parents to monitor and track their child\'s progress. ','Currently I\'m using DuoLingo to learn Portuguese. It\'s an awesome language learning app that is fun and easy to use. However, I wish that the app provided a longform list of all the words I\'ve learned over the past few  months (to access that list I have to log into the website, which is a hassle). Also, it would be cool if there were more things I could earn with the points I get from answering questions correctly. ','My friends and family really make life worth living so I treasure phone calls and get-togethers so much. I also value reading - I love books, magazines, and online content. I can\'t sit through long movies, but long books hold my attention. I\'m a fan of Junot Diaz and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The third thing I spend my time on is organizing, whether it be panels on diversity or other events. I love getting people together to talk about stuff.','5','5','5','5','5','5','5','5','3','5','5','3',NULL,'3','3','1','1','1','1','Katherine','Tu','2katherinetu@gmail.com',' +61 422430282 ','Colleague from the SumOfUs.org Rising Voices Diversity Fellowship','Bridget ','Todd','bridgettodd@gmail.com','804-837-7221','Social justice colleague and friend.

','I\'ve had two notable and impactful mentors in college. One friend, Tia, is a queer scholar from Jamaica and one of my best friends. Her life experiences and daily challenges opened my eyes, and she showed me that art has the power of uniting us all. Another close friend and mentor, Noel, is a queer black scholar who showed me what it means to build bridges between people of multiple, intersecting identities, such as being a queer person of color. ','I learned from Tia that I can use creativity to catalyze change in the world. I organized several multicultural-themed events under her mentorship and used art as a central medium for dialogue.  From Noel, I think that what I gained most was an appreciation for people who take risks and build bridges. It takes a lot of patience to educate and break people out of their boundaries, and I use his models of dialogue to address tough issues. ','One of my friends from my a cappella group at the University of Michigan, Aditi Hardikar, is now the LGBT Leadership Council Director at Democratic National Committee. She\'s an amazing young professional and is working her way up in the world of progressive politics. I have so much respect for her and would love to have the time to learn from her. ','During my internship at the Human Rights Campaign, I worked with a young girl in high school who was interning part time. Her knowledge of politics was exceptional, but her understanding of LGBTQ issues was still budding. I used my education to guide her exposure to LGBTQ issues and tried to steer her frame of mind in the right direction. She\'s going to Princeton next year and I\'m sure we\'ll stay close and in contact. ','My friend Ramiro Alvarez, from the University of Michigan, is a fiery leader among queer and people of color groups around campus. His style is radical grassroots activism. He is incredibly brave with some of his actions around campus and has even been arrested once for an act of civil disobedience. I\'m not quite as public with the work that I do. I like to work in smaller groups and events, but I have huge respect for the outspoken movement he leads.','I once talked to Ramiro about how to be a white male and effective in social justice spaces. He simply said that some people of color will love the work that I do, and sometimes they won\'t. It\'s a matter of sticking to what you believe in, and recognizing you can only to your best among certain groups. That piece of advice helped me let go of trying to please everyone at all times, and focus on how to be a good representative of my identity. ','I think a huge problem is that the LGBTQ movement is focused on overarching civil rights issues, when in reality, there are complex problems affecting LGBTQ youth like substance abuse, mental health, and the experiences of queer individuals of color. I think that the LGBTQ movement could benefit from putting resources into ground-level advocacy, and bolster resources for LGBTQ people who struggle with problems other than marriage equality. ','I think that I\'d love to make an app or website like Vine or Instagram, where LGBTQ people of all walks of life submit short videos about their lives--what they struggle with, who they love, their life circumstances, and their political dreams. I think it would bring LGBTQ people together in a way that hasn\'t been done before, and clips could be used in fundraising and campaigns. ','I use Facebook avidly. I notice that a lot of activists using Facebook are limited by the consequences of such a widely public forum (ie stigma around political facebook debates). I think there should be more social justice/progressive groups available through social media to bring activists together in an interactive way. A different website or application within Facebook could help this become a reality. ','I have many different interests. I am passionate about the future of the LGBTQ movement, and have spent time building skills in my own advocacy. I also love to sing, and have been singing and recording music for years. Additionally, I\'m very interested in Buddhism, and I\'m always trying to learn something new about my spirituality.

','I\'m interested in technology and human rights as well as investigative and data driven journalism (computer-assisted reporting) so ideally something in that nebulous field. ','The most important thing I learned about justice can be summed up as \"to hell with good intentions.\" I took two classes with an amazing professor, Christian Davenport, who teaches about political conflict. The second class was about the efficacy of social movements.  To him, it was all about concrete results and being self-critical. He taught me that bringing about social justice is about being strategic and that good intentions aren\'t enough. ','I was attracted to my current place of work that advocates nonviolent resistance not as moral, but as strategic. It\'s the best way to achieve justice. I\'m constantly questioning what works and what doesn\'t-not just what makes me feel good. When I went on an alternative SB trip to the border of Texas and Mexico to work with undocumented immigrants for a week, I came back and worked on a campaign that had a tangible impact on undocumented immigrants.','I would gravitate toward one of my coworkers at ICNC, Nicola, who is a woman I admire and who is very interested in technology and social justice. She already spearheaded an app called \"People Power\" that provides people with educational materials related to civil resistance. She has worked with a lot of activists and I think she would be a great resource for figuring out what the most useful tool for activists would be. ','I worked at my college newspaper as an editor, and I\'m mentoring one of my old writers. I introduce her to opportunities on campus and put her in touch with people I\'ve met in DC. But mostly we just talk and I give her advice on what I\'ve learned from my short time spent in the real world.','I have trouble delegating work and I tend to exhaust myself because of it. One of my older coworkers is great at trusting people with substantial work, and giving less experienced people like me a chance to rise to the occasion. I sometimes rely too much on rigid organizational structures and I admire that she allows anyone with good ideas to take on more work even when they\'re not as experienced. I need to work on giving people the space to step up. \r\n','That same professor that I was talking about earlier noticed that I undermined myself before I answered questions. He told me to stop using self-deprecating humor to preface ideas or opinions. I realized that I was undermining myself.','A lot of people we work with are nonviolent activists who work in countries with where their online actions are heavily monitored/it\'s hard for them to access certain materials (for example, we have trouble shipping our educational materials directly to certain countries due to suspicious customs agents). I\'m very interested in circumvention technology that would allow activists to access information about civil resistance safely. ','It would let activists access information safely and securely and allow them to get out information about their nonviolent movement without repercussions from their government. \r\n','I use my organization\'s app, \"People Power\" to learn more about civil resistance. But I think a problem with the app is that it\'s too one sided and static. The whole point of people power is to organize people and to dessimate information. I\'d improve it by providing an interactive forum for people to talk to each other in real time. If someone is having a problem in the Ukraine, they should be able to connect with someone with experience to help.','I love going to free lectures. (For example, I went to one about a photojournalist who captured a bunch of iconic images during Freedom Summer.

On one hand, I am a queer African American person who deeply cares about social justice. On the other hand, I had the benefit of first-rate K-12 and university education, and have earned a J.D.

It would be an incredible asset for me to gain these skills so that I can provide web presence, create digital tools, and share knowledge within my various political spaces. ','I am not sure. I\'m currently re-assessing the different skills and training that I\'m fortunate to have, and the ways in which I would like to professionalize these skills. Most likely I would not seek full-time employment with my residency skills. Instead, I\'d offer my skills for free, barter, or engage in low-bono freelance work.

He\'s a white anti-racist who was a SNCC member, and whom I met as an apprentice organizer in college. Larry has taught me the many ways that we can seek and demand justice, and how our individual roles in these struggles must evolve overtime. Larry has become a writer, historian, and recently, an independent legislative candidate. His example reinforces that I can be an activist, writer, shaman, and even coder for justice.','Though I have known Larry for over eight years, I didn\'t reveal the wisdom of his example until a few years ago, and the courage to realize it until recently.  Few lawyers abandon full-time legal practice to fulfill other parts of themselves or seek justice in other roles that aren\'t \"on the side.\" Much like Larry, I\'d like for everything to be \"on the side\" so that I can balance my expertise, and have freedom about with whom, and for what, to share. ','I really don\'t have a mentor of this kind. I\'ve developed radical-lawyer mentors, organizer-mentors, and recently, healing and writing-mentors.

I\'m sure that there are others, like Larry, whom I could ask for guidance about nurturing many justice/liberation paths.  ','This week I re-connected with a mentee, named Virginia, whom I supported in high school, and through college. Apparently, she\'s found guidance in my blog writing over the years, which encouraged her to reach out. We happily just spent two days together: e.g. she sought advice about a situation, shared her own insights about her evolution through her masters program; I supported her intention to be active by exercising with her, and giving her my equipment.','I admire the leadership of my friend, Sara. She is an energetic person whose leadership style is defined by individual encouragement. I admire her level of energy, which serves as a positive model for pursuing success, however defined, and meeting challenges, however significant. I\'m a \"cool-and-collected\" person so my leadership is quieter, more reflective. But her example reminds me that expression really affects a team, and can be extremely vital. ','My most recent piece of constructive criticism was during an annual review process at my current organization. I was told to share more of the work! This feedback was a little surprising because I\'m often very skilled at delegation. But, this feedback was highlighting a pattern that I developed when I was a team of one. It was a helpful reminder that my pattern no longer served me, and that I could let go of work that I had gotten used to completing solo.','Recently I\'ve worked on civil rights restoration in VA. People with felony convictions could restore their right to vote but often had no information about how to do so. The process was simplified for many in May 2013, yet it was still cumbersome to apply. An app would have made the process more accessible. Greater access could bring over 370K people back into the democratic process, at least 7% of the voting age pop, many of whom are poor, of color.','A person could 1) read the basics about rights restoration (what it could, could not do) 2) allow users to answer a 10-question survey to determine eligibility and 3) allow certain users, with non-violent convictions, to submit their registration to the appropriate agency. Others could submit a request for my organization contact them for further information and resources. It would be an easy, one-stop shop for people with questions about the process. ','I use \"Map My Run\" to log my physical activity. It\'s a very useful tool to hold myself accountable for staying active, and challenge me to improve my performance.

','The gap between the poorest and wealthiest Americans continues to rise, leaving millions of low-income hard-working families to live at sub standard levels, with little opportunity to advance their economic situation due to multiple barriers. Accepting intergnerational poverty is immoral, it stops business from gaining ideas, innovation and insight from thousands of talented workers, and inhibits over-all economic growth.','To begin addressing the problem in question 9, as it would relate to former manufacturing cities, commonly referred to as the \"Rust Belt,\" I would develop an application which presents employment and skills training options for people seeking to tap into the emerging field of high tech manufacturing.

I know this program will help me fix the problem and be better suited and qualified for programming-type positions.','I want to work in a programming/data position that is in the social justice area and is different from the political candidate campaigns I have worked on in the past. I want to work for an organization I can believe in and can affect sustained change in the world around me over the years compared to a political campaign, which has a finite life span.','My influence has come from politicians since I have always had a strong interest in politics. A few of those politicians include Theodore Roosevelt and Paul Wellstone from my home state of Minnesota. Theodore Roosevelt because of his work on controlling the excess in capitalism and his trust-busting that came out of that. Wellstone because he continued to support polices to help working class people first ahead of corporate interests.','The ideas and philosophies I learned from these politicians have helped inform my own beliefs, what I advocate and work for.  These policies helped me decide what type of candidates I would support in volunteering and wanting to work for as paid staff on a campaign.  I have spent thousands of hours volunteering and working for causes and candidates who I think come closest to my beliefs that have been shaped by who I have seen and read about.','I have asked one of my first bosses in campaigns to help me and he has given me great advice and things to think about as I try to navigate my way through my career path. I have asked for help from him because we get along very well and we have similar styles in how we work. Part of that is possibly because we both have ADD and have a better understanding of how each other works with that. I see the success he has had and want help to find that.','I would say I have more of a supportive friendship instead of a true mentor relationship between my friend and me.  I have known him since junior high, so close to 15 years. I give my friend advice on schooling, career goals and in general helping him with questions or things he needs help to figure out. ','I admire their ability to make friends and connections and foster leadership by reaching out to a larger group of people and getting constantly involved more easily. This is in contrast to me however, where I am not overly outgoing but slightly introverted so I tend to still connect with people but on a smaller and quitter scale than someone who is very outgoing. This more outgoing style could be difficult for me. ','I have gotten this piece of advice a few times, which is try to not always over-think things and then get caught in over-analyzing the topic or idea when I don’t need to and should decide and move on.  I think part of the reason this is so good for me is that I am more susceptible to this because of my ADD and how my brain goes from one thought to another and just keeps thinking of different thoughts even after I have enough ideas to answer what I needed.','A problem I have thought about is how organizations can best use data they have collected, will collect or find from other places. The problem that can come from this is organizations do not get the full use of the data they collect and are not able to turn that into useable information to best inform their organizations’ future actions.  It’s important to make data more accessible so the organization can make better decisions on what to do next.\r\n','I would design a way so organizations can easily access data. The idea I have is to take an excel/csv file and import it into a program that can visualize data. This likely would be most helpful on data that can be made into maps. Examples would be to see where people live that have made donations or places people live that need services. Ultimately this would make it easy for less technically savvy people to do this type of visualization. ','What I come into contact with most is bad web design or broken websites.  Recently I saw this on my local newspaper’s website. The formatting/layout for a news article was broken.  The problem was the text of the article overlapped with ads and side bar content on the side. The way this can be fixed is they make sure they test the website using the different operating systems and browser combinations to the best of their ability. ','I have a great passion for technology and love to continue to learn about it and use it. I am constantly trying to keep up-to-date in the latest technology available. I have started to learn QGIS and more about SQL as my new topics I am learning about. I love to read books, from a mixture of science fiction, to history and technology. I value my friendships and try to keep in touch with my friends and hang out with them as often as I can.','5','5','5','5','5','4','5','5','3','3','5','1',NULL,'3','1','1','3','1','2','Claire','Gahler','claire.plank@gmail.com','307-620-5980','A friend I met in freshmen year of college that I have stayed friends with after college.','Dusty','Trice','dusty@dustytrice.com','612-865-0066','One of my first bosses from my political work.

At OFA, I mostly help out with running phone banks and planning events relating to Comprehensive Immigration Reform, ever since I was a summer fellow. ','I was taught that the #1 tool in building a movement was your story. Every campaign has a story it needs to tell and reach others with. I want to be able to add context to stories with interactive tools spread by the internet, expressing things both analytically and visually.','I want to work at a place where I can further learn to build web applications, helping to develop tools to help others win elections, track progress, publish, and reach out to others in new ways. I want to work on the next National Field, the next NGP VAN, or the next ThunderClap. ','I learned about justice from the marginalized people in my community, especially the DREAMers and their families. Through their struggle, I learned that power can only be built though finding each other, sharing our stories, and working with solidarity. I\'ve seen people come around full circle to their plight, and I know we can do the same with all other things.','First and foremost, I learned to tell my own story or self, and to find the things that I want to work on and change. Importantly, talking to people and recruting using the 4 C\'s: connect, context, commit, catapult. ','The people I most want to ask for mentorship are the makers and hackers in the tech community. I want to surround myself with people with the hacking spirit, and embrace their competitive spirit. Some of my favorite projects are the result of unexpected collaborations, and there are so many talented people out there that I want to connect with. ','I often mentor my friend Claudia, with tutoring in math. The most difficult problem is not getting her the correct answers, but getting her to be able to reach the correct answer, or often an illuminating answer that happens to not be completely correct, by herself. This requires a great deal of patience for me, because I like to race to conclusions. ','I affectionately called our campaign manager \"Don\" Chris, because he could be absolutely \"godfather\" \'ly and terrifying. He always could get people to make firm commitments to accomplishing goals, and would tell you immediately if they were not up to expectations. I have more of a non-confrontational style, but I always admired his fairness, even though it was sometimes difficult to perform to the level he demanded. \r\n','I was once told that I allowed myself to report to too many bosses. I needed to establish a clear chain of command, knowing exactly who reported to me and whom I needed to report to, so as not to waste valuable productivity doing the same thing twice. This is important in a nonprofit, as there can be many people with very different interests in each program. Ultimately, it made me realize that you have to be the boss of of yourself above all.','One problem I came across was in the recent municipal election. A group here was trying to cross reference data from the corporation commission to money from PACs and donors to establish a link from wealthy developers to a certain incumbent. However, the website could only be queried once per session. This is part of a larger problem of closed city data, but I know that if I could write a script to scrape the data from the site, that data could be used. ','I would use my script to do automated queries to the corporation commission website and store as many results as possible. Arranging the requests into a database, I could host it on a trustworthy server and allow people to access and search it at their own will, by entity, date, amount (all things NOT on the original website) and get it in whatever form they needed it, and to find results they may have not been immediately apparent. ','smartVAN! I\'ve spent countless hours dwelling on endless small improvements that could be made to the app. Simple UI things, like more intuitive Icons to help guide newbies; different ways to organize list results, being able to add more column sections for things that are already in the database and would be simple queries, like userID, phone, last contact date; and the ability to see notes in the household view for the miniVAN app (e.g. \"dogs in yard\").','The #1 thing is myself- learning new skills and practicing old ones with my math texts from school, online courses (<3 coursera), browsing stackexchange, quora, reddit, etc. \r\nCanvassing- I like to talk to people and get a sense on how they swing on different ideas. \r\nProbably most important is my own network.

As a member of CCDC’s Board, I oversaw budget, affordable housing property management, and youth leadership programs. After the residency, I plan to work with a similar urban planning organization to create results-driven change for housing justice.','The first time I met a lawyer, my mother and I were fighting against our eviction. She had little money and little knowledge of the legal system, but she was not afraid to challenge those seen as more powerful than she was. My mother taught me inequality will not end unless we demand it and work for it. She and I won a settlement in our eviction case, and it is her resilience I carry with me in breaking every ceiling I was ever told I couldn’t reach.','Chinatown in San Francisco is home, an ethnic enclave where over 60% of housing is made of cramped Single Room Occupancies. I keep searching for ways to improve quality of life for the residents, so I started a service-learning trip, now in its third year, on housing inequity and environmental justice.

I admire that she delegates well by cultivating strong relationships, and strikes a balance between firm expectations and aggressive leadership. As CFC manager, I have adapted from her to manage 150 volunteers and raise $635000.','In a recent performance review, my supervisor said, “I would like you to work on running new ideas by me first, so we can discuss how to improve them.” Growing up as an only child in an immigrant family, I often had no one I could ask for help with homework or navigating college. This mindset carried over into my professional life. That constructive criticism reinforced the value of interdependency, dispelling the idea that there is strength in silence.','During my Public Policy and International Affairs fellowship, I completed a project on food deserts. People living in food deserts lack healthy food choices and transportation to grocery stores. Their diets and health outcomes are socially patterned by their neighborhoods, which are often urban and low-income areas. Such disparities increase the cost of negative externalities such as obesity, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to health equity.','\"Oasis\" helps people find healthy, affordable, and conveniently located groceries. It uses three metrics: quality, cost, and access. Users enter their location and receive information on food stores, each rated on those criteria. The program delivers data via a website, text, or app, serving a variety of users, including those without smartphones. This technology would help users make informed decisions and develop healthier habits.','Lyft drivers often rely solely on Google Maps to navigate, so different routes and traffic lead to fluctuating prices. For example, the same trip from work to my house varies from $9-15. I would use Lyft more often if pricing were more reliable, and I knew the cost of the ride in advance (similar to how Sidecar operates). Another improvement is a feature that allows the user to input the number of passengers the driver would be picking up.','1) I love baking and have spent the last seven years developing those skills through self-teaching. 2) This year, I will serve on the Board of Directors for the Conference on Asian Pacific American Leadership, a non-profit that builds public service leadership among APAs and promotes APA policy issues. 3) I will participate in the inaugural class of the McKoin Training Academy, designed to give politically active women the skills to run for office.','5','5','5','5','5','4','5','5','2','5','3','1',NULL,'None','None','None','None','None','None','Alexander','Wu','alexanderpwu@gmail.com','703-477-2387','Alex was the Program Coordinator for my Civic Fellowship with the International Leadership Foundation in Washington, DC.','Mike','Bishop','bishop@berkeley.edu','510-642-7811','Mike is the Interim Director of the UC Berkeley Public Service Center, where I participated in the Alternative Breaks program for three years.','Angelina','Yu','ayu@chinatowncdc.org','415-984-1465','Angelina is a senior community organizer at the Chinatown Community Development Center in San Francisco, which I was involved with for eight years.

If I find myself in a position where I cannot find  work with a non-profit, I would like to work in the public sector (socially aimed positions) or doing development/data work for journalist.','My father was the first person to teach me that the world isn\'t a fair place. He    taught me that otherwise good people can find themselves under harsh scrutiny and treated unfairly, ranging from contempt to brutal discrimination.

I had the pleasure of working with Chris Nettles, a senior data analyst. Chris had this great ability to be supportive of someone learning and holding high standards in an encouraging way. I learned quite a bit about the kind of team I would like to be apart of when it comes to sharing knowledge, improving each other, and teamwork.','The piece of criticism is a little difficult to summarize. It\'s basically about confidence and accepting that there\'s always room for improvement. It was good because it made me think, even though I necessarily didn\'t agree with all of the details.

That discussion was a pretty great learning point.','There seems to be some difficult with D.C residents receiving the appropriate notifications from the Tax Office about balances and liens that could result in a person losing their home. The elderly and poor are especially susceptible to receiving enough information to try to act on before complications could arise. I think this problem is important because it could help people stay in their home and benefit from the value of having a home.  ','The system I picture would allow residents to use the information they have to get an approachable explanation to where their home stands. A person could enter their information and see any open liens or statuses that endanger them from losing their home. It would be nice if it could point them to resources to help their particular situation or provide some suggested next steps to try to keep their home.','In light of the recent revelations about domestic spying.

Even as an intern working on social media initiatives with an online-based organization, I find difficulty fully comprehending how exactly technological capacity both broadens and limits the scope of how quickly and efficiently our members from all over the world are engaged.','As a graduate of Political Science, I am striving to integrate my advocacy career goals with my passion for promoting LGBTQ rights and equality, specifically through outreach and campaigning. It is imperative that Asian-Pacific Islander and LGBTQ Americans, who may see themselves as outsiders in their own communities, have credible support and visible representation from advocates in-the-field with whose experiences they can identify.','My All Out team taught me so much about integrative and strategic thinking and planning, and how to successfully leverage limited resources to maximum effect. I have also learned a lot about how to foster meaningful networks/relationships/partnerships, and how the process of engaging and empowering others entails transparency, constant communication, gathering and considering diverse viewpoints, and constantly seeking innovative and creative work methods.','Utilizing the integrative and strategic planning techniques that I\'ve learned thus far, I have tried expanding my interaction with the team, particularly in areas of organizational development, creative, traditional press outreach, fundraising, and technology. In turn, I seek to have a much richer understanding of how marginalized communities are empowered and how various, carefully planned elements working in-sync produce successful campaigns.','As person of color who is leading a cutting-edge, innovative, high-impact global LGBTQ organization, All Out\'s Exec. Director Andre Banks inspires and reassures me in my own professional development. How he is able to deftly cultivate partnerships, manage a tight-knit, collaborative team, and enliven a powerful vision for equality are skills that he can uniquely guide me to understand more, from a perspective that speaks to my experiences as a minority.','While not in an official mentor capacity, I view my vegetarian diet as a catalyst for positive change in others. Through something as innocuous as choosing and enjoying a vegetarian meal, I’ve experienced the impact that my everyday choices can have on how others conceive the implications of their consumption habits. I want my demonstrative action to encourage those capable of adopting less wasteful, more sustainable practices to consider such measures.','One of my AARP supervisors is so admirable in her ability to simultaneously balance multiple tasks and responsibilities while leading on all these fronts, with my primary role being one of support. When I am in a position to delegate responsibilities, I find it essential to enable all team members to take some ownership and direct responsibility in their role, so as to foster individual development and affinity towards collective success.','I’ve always been very idealistic and intuitive when making important decisions. This has sometimes led me to be either over-confident in my abilities or overambitious in my pursuits. With guidance from All Out colleagues, I’m learning more that I can still be strategic and long-term about my goals without sacrificing my principals and intellectual interests, as well as be flexible and open to alternative options or changing interests.','Our increasingly technological, interconnected world has really driven the global movement for LGBT equality through increasing the general knowledge and visibility of LGBT people and facilitating the growth of transnational groups of activists like All Out. However, this newfound camaraderie is still in its infancy, and there is still an organizational vacuum for channeling the energy, talent, and volunteer potential of non-professional activists.','I’d like to help develop a system for engaging a global membership in pursuit of LGBT equality through a platform where they can discuss strategy, share insight and news, and action plan. Ideally, this program would enable users to independently create country-specific volunteer hubs and resource/information centers, with minimal need for management and oversight. Access to this volunteer hub/updates should also be available in real-time in app form.','Customizability and content streamlining-friendly features are highly valued by tech-savvy and creative social media users.

','N/A, I am a full-time student.','Though I know the absolute basics of computer science, I don\'t feel comfortable creating apps and tools; more importantly, though I care passionately about social justice, and want to use technology to broaden what organizations can do, I haven\'t been trained to think about how to apply tech skills to the social justice space.','I plan to apply to organizations that create tools or do data analysis for public service-oriented groups.','My friend Jenny is constantly teaching me about justice, and about mentorship. She was an upperclassman leader in Harvard\'s social justice freshman orientation program. Always informed and angry about tenant\'s rights abuses in NYC\'s Chinatown (her home), she was also aware of the immense privilege she now had as a Harvard student. Both by her example and her words, she taught us to constantly ask ourselves if we can do more. ','I became an upperclassmen leader in the same program, mentoring students who might have a difficult time adjusting to Harvard. I also decided that I have to work in the public sector-- spending my life doing anything but solving problems for the government and community organizations would be a waste.','Reshma Saujani-- the first Indian-American woman to run for Congress. She also founded Girls Who Code, and organization that teaches computing skills to high school age women.','Gurbani Kaur-- a Sikh freshman who had a very, very difficult time transitioning from a strict South Asian home to a college campus. Though my parents are more progressive, I tried to act as a source of cultural support- there if she needed someone to talk or pray with. Part of this mentorship also at times meant teaching her to stand on her own; I had to show her I couldn\'t always be on call for her.','I admire my friend James, who leads a civics education program for Boston middle schoolers. Beyond being fanatically dedicated to his team and his work, James constantly asks himself how he can leave the program better than how he found it. His creativity and envelope-pushing (a bit different from my \"get all the bases covered first\" style), has resulted in a brand new curriculum and teacher training system for the program.','\"Relax. The best things to happen are the ones that aren\'t in your plan.\" This came a few years ago, when I encountered for the first time (of *many*) that reality can often get in the way of the best-laid plans. The person who offered this criticism wasn\'t just telling me to be flexible- they were reminding me to look for the best, and the unexpected, in each left turn.','Sikh gurudwaras are few and far between; in many urban areas, it takes a lengthy combination of subways and busses to reach them. For those new to an area, it can be hard to find your way to a religious support community, or to connect with others like you.','An app to solve this problem would help you find Sikhs (or this could be applied to any small religion or social group) in the area, connect with them, and plan trips to the temple or events on a religious holiday. Ideally it would help to strengthen the community of people who know each other, especially when members are scattered across a city.','I used the city of Cambridge website to learn how to register to vote, and to request a form. The system could be improved by letting residents fill out their information online, so that the form came pre-filled-- this would mean that less people would forget to register.','-Education: I try to learn constantly and well. Education about how tech can help progressive causes is a huge part of that.\r\n-People: I\'m a people person through and through. My energy and motivation comes from connecting with others.\r\n-Joy: Life is short.

I\'ve been working at Chipotle Mexican Grill for about 6 months already and about 2 to 3 months at Fry\'s electronics.','It will help me create applications or maybe even websites that will help us keep people up to date on what\'s going on with immigration and build our capacity, increase the number of members in our org. As of now since we have very few members there\'s no one in charge in the communications task and for my org being able to train someone to do that job will be very helpful to make our org expand and educate, inform and reach out to more people.','I plan to do internships on coding to learn even more and expand my knowledge to be able to apply it into helping even more my organization. Also i\'m considering if there\'s a chance or opening maybe taking a job as a communications coordinator for an upper affiliate org. ','The co-founder of the organization I form part of. I learned that to get what you want you have to keep on pushing for it and never give up no matter how difficult or complex the situation may look like. Also, that you don\'t have to be an expert to be able to contribute, that you learned as you go. The more involved you are the more you learn.','I got more involved in the organization by taking the role as an affiliate lead for United We Dream, representing my team. I also decided to push it even farther by participating in some of the events and rallies they have had such as  participating in actions in Arizona to stop the deportations of people. Getting involved has helped me learn more about the movement and it has encouraged me to  do even more.','I would like for the founder of the organization I form part to mentor me. I\'d like for him to mentor me because I admire his dedication to the organization. He has been doing a terrific job as a leader and I would like to learn those skills, what it takes to be a leader to hopefully one day be a good leader as well. ','I\'m currently mentoring my family and couple of friends. I\'m teaching them about the current bills and acts that have passed regarding immigration and immigrant\'s rights. There\'s always a lot of erroneous information presented to people by the media that people start getting confused about this important topics. ','I admire the leadership of my youth leader at my church. She does a fantastic job at planning more than one event in a short amount of time, while I like to take my time planning one event to make it the best possible. ','When I started working at Chipotle as cashier I was very slow at pretty much everything, it was a bit hard for me to keep up with all my tasks and finish everything on time so the girl that was training me would always point at the things I do well (in a very patient and nice way), but would always give me a tip as to how to improve, which I love because thanks to her continuous constructive criticism on my duties as cashier it helped me improve in my job.','There are not a lot of resources in my area for people to get informed about immigration issues and their rights. This makes it hard for people because sometimes they hear news on tv such as the Deferred Action recently passed, but they just don\'t know how it works. It\'s important to solve this issue so that our community can take advantage of great opportunities that are out there, but that they don\'t know how to get or don\'t even know about them at all. ','If I could make an app or computer program I would create an application that contains information about how does immigration reform look like as of now and what are the new updates, how to apply for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and where to get help not only with DACA, but also for different scenarios, how to get involved by adding links to possible orgs they can join and adding a section for questions and answers. ','I use the pandora app a lot to listen to music. One thing that could be improved would be their search engine. Sometimes I\'m trying to look for an specific song because I don\'t know the name of the singer, but if I try to type in the name of the song it just says no results. I would like for it to allow you to search by song name as well and show you a list of possible singer who sing songs with that same title for you to choose and create your station. ','My passion and hobby has always been helping others, two of the main things I do is volunteer work either as a tutor or volunteer work for my community and the second I spend time contributing and getting involved in my organization.

Many are first in their families to graduate and don\'t know the steps to apply to college and that there are tons of private scholarships they can access.

It would give them a list of updated scholarships available to them, clear steps as to how they can apply to college and apply for instate tuition (if available). It would also provide resources to teachers & guidance counselors so that they can better help undocumented students that come to them for help.','One app that I use every day is Instagram.

They are like my tools and these tools help me stay on the battlefield. ','I stay involved in professional work that allows me to educate and learn about social justice (i.e. my role with NCCJSTL currently). I read as much as possible about old and new theories/practices. In my personal interactions with friends and family, I interrupt and educate oppressive behavior and language with as much compassion as I can muster up in those moments. Overall, I work on becoming more conscious of how I continue to perpetuate and collude. ','The Reverend Deborah L. Johnson of Innerlight Ministries. Her spiritual messages and social justice messages are compassionate, radical and healing. I like to imagine a mentorship relationship that involves her holding me accountable by calling me out on all the things that I still  need to work on, while also helping me understand how I can trust the Diving to guide me. I think I could learn how to further integrate my spiritual and human life through her','Like many other black same-gender loving men, I do have a play child. I could say so much about our relationship over these last five years but there\'s not enough space. Through intentional quality time, I have been modeling different ways of balancing the many aspects of black gay life. I try to model honesty, compassion, communication and most of all,  how to work smart. Honestly, I try to mentor through meaningful, critical and honest dialogue. ','I have to say Beyonce. Even though I think she\'s motivated by things I try not to let guide me (i.e. ego, money, status, entertaining, etc) she is an incredible business woman with a great amount of passion, creativity and relentlessness. She\'s driven, always brings her A-game, and is leading others to joy through her craft. My style of leadership involves more giving of myself, more transparency about my imperfections, and less of a concern for profit.','I was told in a spiritual reading that I need to learn how to speak to my frustrations during interactions with others instead of letting it build up (and ultimately blowing up at them). It was so good because it helped me realize that I struggle with believing that people intentionally try to hurt me or that they know when they\'re hurting me but choose not to stop. Since then, I\'ve been practicing be more patient and of course more honest about conflict. ','I\'ve worked with young men of color who have sex with other  men for almost ten years now. Being a part of this community, and being a service provider, has allowed me to see the real challenges facing so many of us, especially when it comes to taking sexual risks.  I think at the root of all of this is a need for survival and need for self-love. If we teach people how to love themselves, we can teach them how to love others and survive in healthy ways. ','I would like the app to allow people to express themselves through digital art. It could allow them to make songs on the spot, paint or draw, or build a quick web page to express how they\'re feeling in that moment. I would try to incorporate some kind of affirmation component to the app which would allow the users to always make a positive message to interrupt self-defeating thoughts, traumatic memories, etc. ','I can\'t put into words what it is about Facebook\'s news feed which drives me crazy, but sometimes its overwhelming. Honestly, I wish I could just get rid of the option to see the news feed and something else displayed as my primary page. ','Honestly, because of where I am right now and all of my obligations the three main things are preparing programs for my job, studying for classes and preparing for the weekend yoga teacher training modules.

I provide resources for undocumented families in the Greater Houston area and engage them to become involved by helping others to apply. I help provide legal support to applicants for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), inform people about DACA, and educate undocumented students about financial aid. ','This training will help me develop new resources to communicate with the people we serve in a faster and more effective manner. I would first like to create a game that teaches our volunteers the origins of the immigrant movement. Second, I would like to create a website for our Houston chapter so that we can inform the people we serve. Last, I would like to develop and app or a program that would engage people to act and help the undocumented community. ','I would like to work in an area where I will promote social justice, that is similar to the work that I do in my current job. ','My mom has been my first teacher. She taught me to create opportunities for others, constantly adapt, and to be fearless. She often let me sit with her during the planning stages of a project since I was about ten and took me along when she organized. She also shared with me her experiences throughout the years and I saw her adapt and work well with people with differing viewpoints. Lastly, she is working in one of the most dangerous places to help others.','I am now working on a project that my mother has worked on for years. I am part of a new team that is creating projects to engage and inform the undocumented community. Although I often fear being in front of many new faces, I remember the reason for my being an organizer and I put my qualms aside. ','I want to ask my friend, Frances Valdez to mentor me. She is a young professional who has been dedicated to working for the immigrant community for more than ten years. She has provided a lot of moral support and professional guidance to me in the past. ','I am mentoring a high school senior, she is undocumented and does apply for DACA . I bring her to the presentations we hold in the community centers and show her how to organize events, work with large groups of people, and engage others to participate with Own the Dream. ','I admire the woman\'s ability to quickly organize large groups of people. She is able to delegate responsibilities so well that she has hosted large events in a short amount of time. My style is different in that I work best with small groups and at a slower pace. I feel more comfortable delegating responsibility to small groups of people. ','I was told that I needed to have fun when working. It was such great advice because I didn\'t realize that I took things too seriously when working in the office. I found myself being less stressed out and working better in a team. ','I think that the majority of the people who have citizenship don\'t feel the urgency to support immigration reform and that lack of action against deportations is having an effect on the community. Many people don\'t know that more than 1,000 undocumented men, women, and youth are being deported every day from the United States. This has had an economic, social, psychological impact on many families who call the United States their home. ','I would create a game app that interests people and engages them to learn about undocumented community. ','I use a facebook application and it can be improved by automatically showing only the status posts, pictures, and stories solely based on a unique set of keywords and topics that I want to appear on my feed.

','My father has pastored Allison Presbyterian Church in Little Rock, Arkansas for 30 years and recently retired from 20 years as a county circuit court judge.  He preached and administered justice every day.  What resonates with me most is his compassion for the ‘least of these’ and the people he saw every day in court. He taught me about the humaneness in making mistakes, the importance of forgiveness, and the necessity in treating others with respect. ','My father’s guidance has driven me to be intentional in not allowing my life to simply be all about me.  I believe in the power of community and how it takes much more than a few to raise and build a committed and productive member of society.  I strive to leverage my privilege to break down oppressive forces, and I have been working hard to do so through community organizing, voter work, and employment in progressive youth leadership development.   ','I would like to ask my boss and Director of Youth Leadership Programs for PFAW, Commissioner Andrew Gillum, to mentor me.  He’s been a leader of elected progressive officials across the country, but more importantly to me, he’s demonstrated an open and committed attitude to youth progressive change that I want to live by and inspire in others. ','I currently mentor eight youth through Young People For.  I assist them in creating sustainable projects for social change in their communities and on their college campuses.  I help them vision their desired outcomes, create short-term and long-term goals to achieve these outcomes, budget and fundraise for their projects, and enact them.  I also help them discuss ways to improve their personal leadership capacity, and I serve as a listening ear.','My leadership style is very open and relationship based, even though I prefer to work independently.  My supervisor, Laura, has an admirable style of leadership that differs from mine.  Her leadership involves multiple, weekly meetings with every single person on staff.  I support this practice, because it keeps everyone abreast of our projects and maintains team morale.  I, however, am more inclined to fewer check-ins and a more hands-off approach.  ','The most poignant piece of constructive criticism that I\'ve gotten is to understand the usefulness in asking for help.  I enjoy working independently as well as working in a group setting, but the two are not mutually exclusive.  When working alone, I sometimes create a silo around my current project, but even then, it is important to seek help and have someone with more experience assist my process.  It helps in improving efficiency and team connectivity.','The prison industrial complex relies on a disproportional incarceration of black and brown community members.  In short, this contributes to dismantled families and communities, black and brown unemployment, racial segregation and prejudice, crime, and inequality as a whole.  We must solve this issue to restore faith in a democratic system meant to protect and sustain the fair rights and liberty of all our country’s diverse inhabitants.     ','In my work as an organizer for Organizing For America in North Carolina, re-registering felons who believed their voting rights had been removed greatly impacted me.  I would like to consider the implications of an application that helps all people better understand their legal rights.  This app would not only inform users of their voting rights, but also other critical laws on a state-by-state basis that often are applied more harshly to non-whites.   ','I’m an ardent user of Craigslist when searching for part-time jobs, housing, or useful items.  I can virtually find anything on the website/app, but I feel the interface is outdated and could be improved to present users with a more personalized experience.  Currently, I’m looking for a bike to make my D.C. commute a quicker.  I would appreciate email blasts of bikes that fit the parameters I seek or an app familiar with my previous search results.','Work certainly expends most of my time.  Beyond my 9 to 5, conversations with the youth I mentor often require phone calls and meetings in the evenings.  Secondly, I spend a lot of my time with friends.  I enjoy building relationships, and all of my closest friends are very active.  I support them by attending a few of their work events, service events, and art performances each week.

She draws people in and is always very uplifting and fun to be around (sure helps with recruiting people and keeping them around)','I was told to let people help me. It is hard to do things right, but it is even harder to do everything, and to do it right. ','While helping people apply for DACA, one big challenge is helping them keep track of all they need to have to apply; making sure that they have good reference material in they understand is crucial to their success. Being low income, people don\'t always have affordable access to the translation services they need or access to the right records by the time they come to our free workshops. Other than money, this is being the second biggest challenge.','An app that will tell and keep track of the requisites for x and have quality information in the right language every step of the way; it would allow the user to certify his own birth certificate\'s translation, give the user a guide in obtaining the appropriate records, and finally give them a list of places where the user can get free or low cost help (referrals) as well as directions to such places. Ideally it\'d help them help themselves.','Oh there are just so many things that could be improved, but necessity triumphs: In the low income community not all of us have access to a computer but a big majority have a cellphone (any smartphone). When applying for a job (or using other crucial online services really), most of it is online and not all are accessible through a cellphone. Maybe it\'s not so much an app but it is a problem.

Watching my family, especially my parents struggle with the immigration process only confirmed my sense justice and its effect on people of color. Justice in this country is not impartial or even fair. This is why there is a need to continually struggle for real justice. ','My struggle is to work within the system that is already in place, while making sure that those on the bottom are not being crushed. I continually try to expand my knowledge and skills to be a versatile activist and contributor to the movement. ','One of my colleagues is a developer with a major company here in Seattle. He was recently able to expand his work and make employee giving the majority of his work. Prior to being able to move in to this department (that he helped create), he was able to do his usual work, start this project, and motivate others to help him. His work has been very inspiring. ','My department takes on a full-time, AmeriCorps volunteer for 11-months out of the year. Most of the time, AmeriCorps members are relatively new to the non-profit sector and the challenging work that our organization does. I meet regularly with this person during work and after to support them and the challenging work we do. Sometimes it is troubleshooting an incident and others it is going for a walk to make sure we are caring for ourselves. ','I am a person that tends to make sure all of the logistical pieces are in place and am in the background much of the time, so the folks with the bullhorns standing in front of the crowd are often who I admire. In particular, my former supervisor is one of these people. She is not afraid to put herself in the spotlight and she does so with grace and poise. She is always very quick on her feet and able to switch gears at a moments notice. ','I have been told that I too often sell myself short. I believe it is an excellent piece of criticism because it is still something I am consistently working on. I have a lot to offer and I should not be afraid to put that out there. ','Skill-sharing between organizations. Organizations are often feeling the budget crunch and unable to hire folks to do some of the more specialized activities. They may only need these skills for a project, but not long enough to contract a person. Hiring gets more and more expensive with each highly specialized skill, which can make it difficult to hire the folks on the ground. ','An app that allows organizations to post skill-swaps would be a start. For example: Organization A needs ten hours of a specialized skill on a project. They post this to the app. Organization B has someone who can do Organization A\'s project, but Organization A is not a direct match for B\'s project. The app will continue to search for skills that match the needs of each organization and notify them as necessary. ','Many apps try to do too many things at once. For example, my smartphone\'s OS has a built in messenger app that combines SMS, online chats, and video chatting. I find myself accidentally sending an SMS when I meant to send an online chat and vice versa. It is not user friendly or intuitive, which is the problem I find with many apps. It could be somewhat simplified and less clunky. ','My time is often spent: with my family, my work, and cooking and eating. Family and food are interconnected. My parents both worked long hours and still do, but they always made time to sit down with us for at least one meal a week. It was an opportunity to share food and decompress. Most importantly, it was a time to be together. Food and cooking continue to be a major part of community for me. This sense of community flows in to the organizing that I do.','5','4','4','4','4','4','4','4','3','4','4','3',NULL,'2','2','1','2','1','1','Tara','Moss','taram@realchangenews.org','206 441 3247 ext 204','current supervisor','Mijo','Lee','mijo@socialjusticefund.org','206 624 4081 ext 102','former supervisor','Holly ','Smith','hollyelizabethsmith@gmail.com','206 794 8369','friend and former colleague',1,'I have received a Master of Social Work degree from the University of Washington and a Bachelor Degree from the University of Puget Sound.

I do have a beginner\'s knowledge of Spanish from my studies in college and working with the community in East Harlem here in New York City.','Growing up as an African American female in a small southern town, I did not have the resources or guidance to really learn about the rapidly growing tech field or if someone like me could even have a role in it. My parents were first generation college students, and their parents were poor black farmers. The first real exposure I had to building websites was during my junior year of college.','Currently, I am a data and communications specialist for a wonderful food service company called Red Rabbit. We provide almost 20,000 healthy meals to students/teachers that are locally sourced and homemade in Harlem. I supervise our data operations team which is responsible for managing the daily operations schedule and production orders for different meal service programs & caterings. ','If the 3 stages in mastery are being, knowing and doing, then I\'m currently in the knowing stage. I want to learn more and gain the coding background to better help nonprofits or social entrepreneurs succeed. I\'ve seen, first hand, the progress my organization had by creating better technology systems. I want to create more efficient and accessible databases that any of our staff members can use whether you are a business manager or a low-level prep cook.','I would like to continue may career path as an IT analyst or front end developer. My overall goal is to become a Director of Information Technology, Chief Technology Officer or IT consultant for nonprofits or mission driven businesses domestic or even abroad.','My father taught me the most about justice. Lenton O\'Neal is 80 years old and spent 30+ of those years as a teacher. My father is older than most parents of my generation and lived during the civil rights movement. For his children, there was never a question of furthering your education, not voting or being involved in the community. You were expected to do it all. He taught us what injustices he faced, and how we can\'t take them for granted.','Beyond getting my college degree and being a good citizen, I\'ve always made it a point to be involved in my community. I did a year of domestic service as an Americorps member in NYC. I coordinated a program to help students create service projects. For the last two years, I\'ve worked for a mission based company that provides healthy meals and food education for schools. I\'m also work with a mentoring program and food projects throughout the city.','I would love for my CEO\'s main investor and board member, Kesha Cash, to be a mentor for me. She actually told me about CFP\'s application. I admire her for wanting to invest in companies that make a social impact and are minority owned. Even though she is not tech based, she is very knowledgeable about the industry and has an impressive career.','I have a \"mentee\" named Cassandra through an organization called NY Needs You. She is pre-med and a first year generation college student. I coach her through professional development seminars and encourage her in any way I can to finish her education. I helped her with transferring, declaring a major and developing an effective schedule to balance school and work. I\'m currently trying to help her secure a summer internship.','Jon Melo, a fellow co-worker, is a leader in our office by his professionalism and ability to take hold of situation as well as own it. As the business manager, he has lead our company by meticulously organizing our HR and operations, regardless of he fully understands all the aspects of food service or not. We are very similar in terms of taking initiative, but I\'m not one to fully take hold of situation if I don\'t fully understand it. ','A former supervisor told me to take more pride in my writing by slowing down and making sure it\'s correct. One of my first jobs was answering help desk emails. I would go through them all quickly, and I didn\'t realize how important my answers were in terms of representing the company. I was actually writing and tailoring their first policies. Now, I never take any job responsibility lightly. I make a point to always do my best, even if it\'s an email.','One of my passions is getting more resources to lower income communities. After living with a low income in NYC through Americorps, I was surprised how many great services I qualified for in terms of housing, education or professional development. I had access and guidance through my office. Many of my cooks, drivers and porters I work with now are completely unaware of some these services. They want to advance themselves, and there are ways out there.','I would like to create more user friendly health and human databases for state agencies that \"regular joes\" can access & use. They could simply find out what services they can qualify for based on income or status. If they don\'t necessarily qualify for the state service, it could also return charities or non-profits that provide temporary housing, food pantries or educational services. They wouldn\'t have to stand in line all day to speak to a case worker. ','MTA Bus Services created a very simple app for checking on the next bus that will be coming to your stop. You text the bus stop code to a number, and it will send you back the next approaching buses by distance. I wish it was a full mobile app with interactive maps that had a better way of finding bus stop codes. There apparently is a formula to figure out the code, but it\'s complicated. It just needs a map that can find your location and codes near you.','Outside of my job and checking on my family, I work with 3 main organizations volunteering my time. I work with God\'s Love We Deliver, New York Common Food Pantry through NY Cares and New York Needs You. All of these organizations do a wonderful service for people throughout NYC.

I spend the weekends djing weddings, parties and bars.','It would help me to organize things on the internet. I would have the tools to bright my towns are to a new platform.','I hope to actually find a non profit art organization that I could help to come up with creative technological ways to touch peoples lives through the arts.','The one person who taught me about justice was historian Staugton Lynd. I had the pleasure of working with him with his play Lucasville: Untold Story of A Prison Uprising. That is when I found out that the arts can change people\'s minds about controversial subjects. The arts can be a powerful tool in the fight for justice.','I have been trying to use my art to help inspire people to fight for their causes. I\'ve helped to organize productions for Lucasville. I\'ve used music to speak out against the dangers of fracking. I\'ve even did a production for the Occupy Movement.','It\'s really hard to pick just one person, but if it would be anyone, I think it would be my mother. She has lots of connections to the community. She has had a mirad of life experiences, from an inner city pastor to a fracking activist. She also is probably the one person who knows me best. ','I am mentoring a child from my mother\'s old church named Corey Lee. He really like the production work I do in music. I try to teach him all the things I\'ve learned in music production. ','My friend Ian James runs a recording studio. He has been able to take an abandoned building that had water damage and turn it into a very clean and neat recording space. The ability to take really bad spaces and have a plan to turn them around is something I lack, which I admire about him.','April of 2012 someone told me about a dj set I did, and how it could have been better. It was the first time in my life I actually listened to criticism, and instead of taking offence I actually listened and did what they told me to do. It has helped me ever since then too. ','I think one thing that hurts my community is a lack of knowledge of what is available to them as a citizen. Almost all the time there are programs that would help with many issues people in the city face, but they have no idea that it\'s happening. The programs often end because of lack of community involvement.\r\nIt ends up not helping people, but also discourages people from trying to help in the future.  ','I would make an app that had all of the programs that where happening in the city. A person would put in their Age, gender, what, side of town they lived on, and if they had children. The app would then give them the list of activities and programs they could take part in. ','Probably the app I run the most is facebook. I think the facebook app would run a lot better if it would save what you were doing on the last page you were on. Too many times I would be writing a status, and then someone would im me.

I generally understood that white supremacy was rampant, but I didn\'t realize how entrenched and encapsulated I was in it myself.','Boycotts have become increasingly complex, as multi-national corporations are globalized and take on more and more sophisticated green/pink washing campaigns.

He helped me with a few hurdles in New Jersey and I was glad for his assistance. \r\nIf he would be willing, I would love to meet with him more often so he could help show me how to create a wider-ranging and more expansive data and tech program.','I know a young Egyptian undergraduate.  He tended to have very traditional ideals on how all women should live, so I introduced him to some women I knew who had interesting lives and ambitious life goals.\r\nWhen he showed an interest in starting his university’s first student-run newspaper, I introduced him to writers and editors I knew.  I also gave him articles and brought back books for him from abroad and taught him the basics of leading volunteers.','Molly Griffard is my old field director.  In training she organized team-building activities & ice-breakers into the schedule, including a rafting trip to give a chance to connect and develop trust before campaign stress set in.  She made sure that there were group activities and outings at regular intervals during the campaign as well.  I learned from how she built a team, but I can be more hands off, whereas she keeps tight control of all activities.\r\n','My father told me that I needed to be more proactive in maintaining my personal network.  I never thought that much of it when I was younger but as I have gotten older I am glad that I still talk regularly with friends from high school, college, or previous campaigns.  They have helped me out when I needed them and I have learned a lot about myself by keeping a network of people who have known me all my life.','As an Egyptian American, I feel very distressed that some of the resources that I can take for granted here, like a voter file, are not available in Egypt.  People participate in demonstrations, protests, and marches, but there isn’t an organized way to channel the interest towards other forms of civic engagement like phone-banking or get-out-the-vote programs that stem from a lack of data on who supporters and potential supporters are and where they are.','I would like to develop a rudimentary version of Minivan to make collecting data from canvasses easier. ','I have a very diverse group of friends on Facebook and I often turn to one or more of them when I am travelling or doing something like considering different jobs or universities.  Facebook allows me to communicate with a friend who I haven’t seen in years, it doesn’t allow for sophisticated searches of friends by their experiences.\r\nFacebook could be improved if we could search friends, not just by work and skills such as cooking or excel.','I have been a martial arts enthusiast since I was a child and I still take martial arts classes several days a week.  It is my favorite way of expressing myself and helps me relax.  I volunteer one day a week at Community Health Advocates helping people with their health insurance needs.

','After finishing the program I plan to look for employment that allows me to continue helping my community, which will allow them to help others, creating a domino effect. I would prefer to work with youth because if the change starts at the youth, the future will inevitably be changed as well. ','Mr. Herbert, my high school history teacher taught me about justice. When learning about events in history, such as the Holocaust, slavery and the civil rights movements, which were all injustices, I learned that the belief of inequality is very destructive. I learned that justice is a necessity for mankind although it is not necessarily present all the time. ','I put my beliefs about justice and equality to action everyday by always treating others just no matter what, and speaking up when I see wrongdoing. I believe it is everyone\'s job to point out an injustice because to ignore it is to bear guilt. ','I want to ask my older sister to mentor me because she is a school teacher that works with children. I would like to learn from her how to influence youth positively for the future. ','As an older sister and aunt, I am a mentor to my nephew and brother. Being someone that has more experience than them, I feel obliged to speak to them about my experiences and help them with anything they may need assistance with. ','W.E.B. DuBois is someone whose leadership I admire because he was an activist against racism and a very successful man. His style of leading is different from mine because he was vocal nationally. Although I am vocal, my opinion or beliefs don\'t surpass my community. ','The best constructive criticism I ever received was instead of trying to follow in the footsteps of my siblings, to find what I love and do my best at it. This was great because for most of my youth, I wanted so badly to imitate the career choices of my siblings even though I wasn\'t happy doing so. I became comfortable with making my own choices after I was told that, and became more comfortable being unique. ','A problem that I see is that families don\'t have money for basic needs. ','I would create a program or app that is inspired by craiglist but there will be a community exchange for goods and services. Someone would post an ad saying what they need and what they have to offer. Then someone else who has what that person needs would respond to the ad and they would make an exchange.

He\'s an artist that travels around the world working on murals and other projects with other artist from across the world.

This criticism was great because it helped me on future projects and endeavors and it made it easier for me to see where my work needs improvement.','The problem I see in a lot of communities of ethnicity is the prices of good quality food in the grocery stores. The prices for the food in these communities is raised, making it harder for people in these neighborhoods to afford better quality food at descent prices. I think this problem needs to be solved because nutrition affects every part of life.

And by \"best\" I mean that the person representing you must believe in justice and know how to work within the system (resources, statues, history) to achieve justice despite the amount of money one has pay to for such services. I learned that from a small claims case I filed against my landlord some 15 years ago. Sometimes you are the best representation.','I use this in my life daily as most of my friends come to me when they are faced with legal issues.

She is more direct when it comes to getting things done and she knows how to get more people engaged. My approach to leadership differs because I prefer everyone to take on a leadership position, but have more difficulty getting people involved on a particular issue.','An excellent piece of criticism I\'ve gotten is opening up more.

I am highly proficient in both languages. ','I am an undocumented Hispanic female who is a first generation college graduate. Women are usually not in the tech sector, and Hispanics are underrepresented in college. I am undocumented, which means that I have been excluded from many aspects of life such as driving, working for a paycheck and getting financial aid for the last two decades. ','I am a social innovations intern at the National Domestic Workers Alliance. I am working on a lean start-up pilot initiative that could potentially help domestic workers market themselves and secure more business. Through the use of social media platforms, I help to empower workers so both their job access and wages improve in the housecleaning, nanny and elder care markets. ','I am a DREAMer, and I have faced a lot of hurdles. One of them is access to a bank account and to credit. There are a lot of misconceptions about opening these types of accounts amongst the undocumented population. I believe that creating a financial website that helps undocumented immigrants better understand the financial sector would help my community. I cannot do this without the technical training.','I love empowering my community. I contributed to Make the Road New York prior to my internship at National Domestic Workers Alliance. Make the Road New York taught me the value of organizing. I want to make a difference in people\'s lives because I understand the feelings of despair. I applied to Teach for America, as I am looking into non-profit opportunities where I can use my education and skills to improve the lives of others.','Natalia Aristizabal-Betancur from Make the Road New York taught me about justice. This is because prior to working at Make the Road New York, I felt ashamed about my undocumented status. She taught me that it was neither my own fault nor my family\'s, but rather a broken immigration system. She introduced me to other undocumented leaders in my community, and nurtured me to become the person I am today.  ','Natalia is an organizer, and has gotten arrested multiple times due to her involvement in civil disobedience actions. Fear has consumed me for the past 20 years, and I still struggle with speaking publicly about my life as an undocumented immigrant. I remind myself that my story has a greater value. It has the ability to soften the hearts of Congress, and pass immigration reform this year.','I work with a woman named Margot Brandenburg. She is a fellow for the Nathan Cummings Foundation. She has worked in the fields of microfinance and economic development, and has a lot of knowledge that she could share with someone who is interested in these fields. I mentioned to her that I attended the Lend for America Conference at UPenn. She recently introduced me to the staff at Brooklyn Cooperative. She is very supportive of my career goals.','I tutor two elementary school children. I am teaching the first grader to read, as she is behind in school. I am helping the third grader prepare for the state English and Math exams, which will determine whether or not he gets promoted to fourth grade. Both my students are Hispanic, and their parents work long hours. This reminds me of my own childhood, and how many obstacles students like us face to graduate from high school and go to college.','I admire my current director, Palak Shah. She is very good at simplifying information, so everyone in the room is on the same page. She also aims to include everyone in our start-up, so no one ever feels excluded. This sense of teamwork is unlike anything I have been exposed to in the past, and I think it\'s very valuable in the nonprofit sector. ','I have been told that I am very stubborn by everyone. However, the same people have admired how defiant I was when I was told that I could not go to college. I become focused to the point of sometimes being obsessive when there is an obstacle that I need to overcome. So, when someone tells me I am strong-willed, uncompromising or inflexible, I remember all the times this has allowed me to persevere when the odds were stacked against me. ','There are 11 million people who do not have access to financial institutions. They cannot open bank accounts, have lines of credit to obtain a loan for a car or house, or have a credit score. The reason is that there are barriers to becoming banked amongst the undocumented. It is important to solve this problem because it is very difficult to improve your quality of life without access to credit.','Forums are the best way to know which banks are undocumented-friendly. I would create a website that allows undocumented immigrants to know state-by-state, which banks are best to open a savings account, secured credit card, and acquire loans. It would help small businesses as well, by acting as a matchmaker with financial institutions. This could provide funding so they may expand. ','I use pure android on my Nexus 4. I wish I could split my screen at times, so while I am reading using the Play Books app, I would not have to go back to my home screen in order to use something like the calculator app. Another use for split screen is text messaging or web surfing while being placed on hold on a call.','I mentor a high school student in Brooklyn. She is currently a junior, and I am helping her with the college selection process. I volunteer at a nonprofit in Harlem, Peace of Mind Projects, as a research assistant.

I took part of CT Student for a Dream a non-profit organization managed my student Dreamers that fight for social justice when I was in high school due to being denied an internship at Sikorsky due to my status.','I am currently working part-time for a non-profit that works on Educational Reform. I am the youth program coordinator. I work with high school students that reside or attend Bridgeport public high schools. Bridgeport being a city with low high school graduates and poor teachers, the students I work with are trained to organize and work along with the Board of Edu. to help bring programs to Bridgeport high school students to help them get to college.','I believe this training will help me organize my community by providing easy to use media, websites, and engage them in online actions as well as petitions. With the learning I will receive I would be able to outreach and engage my community, especially youth as a way to turn their actions and voices into online life.','Finishing residency from this program, I would feel more comfortable learning similar and more complex programs. With this I plan to expand my current online and youth organizing skills by taking and using digital tools. I will also search more online organizing opportunities with various organizations.','One person who has showed me what justice is, would be my 13 year old sister. Her coming from school each day and talking about her day shows me that justice doesn\'t only come from adults, but starts with children. She hates bullying, racism, inequality, and discrimination. She has taught me that if a 13 year old is not afraid to stand up or speak for justice, even if alone then why should an adult. ','Because of my sister I have been more active and involved in my community. I have taken leadership positions as well as various service opportunities where I have been able to influence and get my community involved in social justice movements.','One of the person I would like to have as a mentor would be on of my co-workers. She works to fight for educational reform. Many times the people we work with don\'t like us having protests or actions, however she is a target because she the only non-minority worker. I admire her strength to not give up or let others influence her actions.','I currently mentor 5 high school students. I help them organize campaigns in their schools. Some of the things we have done in the past 4 months are youth leadership development such as: learning how to share story of self, identifying and analyzing problems, planning backwards, writing a proposal,and  working on a timeline for their future work and actions.','A persons leadership style which I admire is my manger. She works strictly, passionately,and is very organized from having a meeting to having a training. Her leading style differs form mines because I like to connect with each person I work with. To me working strict and organized is important but also knowing who i am working with is important.','The most common criticism I have gotten was for being to reserved. After receiving this criticism I have learned to be more outspoken as well as approachable. Yet still being a good leader even as an introvert.   ','One of the problems I see affecting my community constantly is many undocumented people not knowing what their rights are. Some factors for this problem are because people either don\'t know the language or don\'t know where to find resources. I feel this is important because many people are still afraid. If they continue hidden then change wont be possible or as effective. ','I would make a bilingual application that would include their rights, and local centers or offices of places for people to go and receive more information. This application would connect to an emergency hotline, because many time officers or other  people  don\'t treat other residents equally. ','An application I feel can be improved is a local application for my city Bconnected. This application helps the city residents connect with a service department for assistance such as a recycling bin request to tax issues. This application can be improved by having a language to chose from, easier to navigate, and to connect directly to news in the city instead of having to switch to a browsing app and searching it.','1.

I have her to thank for it she always leads me in the right way.   ','Learning what i have from my grandmother I stay working with kids. I got into the recreational centers early i was bout 13 when i wanted to become part of teen council. From 13-21 i was the president of teen council. I got to give back   alot of the kids have never been out of the inner city i got them they first trip to Ceder point and 6 flags. I learned how to manage money leadership skills. ','I actually have a mentor that keeps me pretty motivated. Her name is Kim esley she was the one who help keep me on the right path and the reason i got to help alot of the youth in the inner city. I ask Kim to be my mentor when i was bout 15. She always had a game and not to metioned she was a great boss to work for as well. She never give up on us and im thankful to have some one like Kim in my life.','I\'m not currently mentoring anyone right now but I do have a few youth I keep a eye on.

Kim look at me eye to eye and told me your never going to get no where talking and acting the way you are. Your smarting then your acting . Start acting your age and not your shoe size. I took it and run with it. Till this day remembering that conversation to help me.','The biggest problem in my community is that are youth dont have no type of programs I had coming up. I know computer was one of the first thing to caught my attention and seeing how hi tech things are in and bigger then ever. I know having computers class again will stop some of the teenage drug use volients and gangs ect. They need programs just like I did growing up.\r\n','My Program would be for every age and they we be allow to do research for class. It would have to be productive. If they coming to use my program/class it would be to be to better they self in a career. To maintain a steady life. I would make it a easy cousr so any one can pick it up even senoirs. If not i would always be around to make sure they get what they looking for. ','Of course i use facebook  to keep intouch with family and friends. One way i think can improve it is to have a age verification. I see alot of youth on facebook then adults they need to be more strick with who they let on there website and try to get a better verification system then they have my 10 year ole niece have a facebook.

I have yet to find a happy medium to combine my interests in women\'s rights and radio, so I\'m exploring ways to fuse the two myself.','Dr. Ivan, a humanitarian activist that I worked with in Peru with Project Suyana (mentioned above), taught me countless lessons about justice. Every facet of Dr. Ivan\'s life is about giving back to the community. He is a medical doctor who could live a comfortable life practicing in a hospital; instead, he spends his free time running clinics, teaching, and helping aid groups. He taught me ways to improve the lives of women in Peru and worldwide. ','I strove to follow Dr. Ivan\'s example while working on humanitarian aid projects in Peru, where I built clean-burning stoves in a rural village. These stoves help save the lives of women who face indoor aid pollution while cooking for their families. I used my time in Peru to help as many lives as I could, and I learned to not take simple amenities for granted. Back in the United States, I spend more time volunteering and encouraging others to do the same.','I want to ask Kyle Norris to mentor me. She works for Michigan Radio where she is a double minority--she is a gay woman. With these identities, she was not treated well when she started work in public radio. Instead of following a traditional career path, she turned to freelancing and created her own occupation. I admire her hard work and perseverance. On the radio, Kyle shares her voice with women and LGBT individuals, giving them a role model.','I am currently mentoring my housemate, Alice, an international student from China. I am the president of a cooperative house of 12 people, and Alice is a house member I have been helping this year. She is applying to graduate programs in math in the United States, a field that is hard for women. I\'ve been helping her with her applications and essays, along with teaching her about American culture. I see myself as both a mentor and friend to Alice.','Returning to my involvement with Project Suyana, I admire my co-president, Michelle. As a leader, I often find myself taking on too many tasks, thinking I am the best qualified to carry them out. Michelle is helping me learn to delegate tasks to other group members. This type of leadership allows our group to accomplish more, and helps other members become more active in the organization. ','A friend told me that I can be too critical and dismissive of people who don\'t share the same opinions as me (especially regarding women\'s rights). I took this to heart, realizing the truth in the statement--it\'s important to understand what people with different opinions are thinking and why they think this way. Rather than labeling these people as close-minded and ignoring them, I should try to understand their ideas and try to reach an understanding. \r\n','The problem I see in my community is the same problem I want to solve by joining Code for Progress--women have limited access to tech, math, and science. Young women need role models to encourage them to pursue these passions, to overcome the criticisms they\'ll face as minorities in these fields. As I shared in my profile, I was interested in studying math; but being a woman and facing harsh sexist remarks, I abandoned this interest.','I want to combine my radio skills with Code for Progress tech skills by making a podcast and app that highlights women\'s success stories. In the weekly podcast, I will interview women who are successful in a variety of fields. They can share the hardships they faced and how they overcame them. The podcast can then be distributed with an app, that can feature additional written content and downloads. This technology can help young women find role models. ','I find many engaging news articles from my Facebook news feed. However, I have to scroll through pages I\'m uninterested in to find these. Facebook currently allows us to block certain people from our feed, but I want even more control, like blocking links from certain sources (BuzzFeed, EliteDaily) or keywords/acronyms (\"10 things you,\" \"omg,\" or \"lol\"). This improvement would allow us to curate our Facebook news feeds to fit our own interests.','1)Co-Op Home: I\'ve lived in a cooperative house--a community of 12 strangers living and working together--for 3 years. I\'ve been the president for 2 years. \r\n2)Radio: I work on stories for Michigan Radio. I pride myself in finding stories that create awareness and understanding--including stories about the environment, education, women\'s rights, and injustices. \r\n3)Thesis: I just finished a 100-page honors thesis about gender and Couchsurfing.

To be a person of color and homosexual is a double threat; I recall reading one of Audre Lorde\'s autobiographies where she admitted: \"My child was teased by the other children not because her mother was a dyke, but because she was a n*gger.\" I am also a female-bodied indiviudal who often battles misogyny in the workplace, where it is assumed that I\'m less capable.\r\n','I currently work once a week for a few hours as an Arabic instructor through a language company.

','I\'m interested in the crossover of African and Middle Eastern cultures. Kate Zaidan has taught me a lot about justice; she always encouraged me to pursue Arabic and travel in order to transform that knowledge to social justice building. She also taught me that supporting a community for the moment is not enough. You must possess a genuine interest in committment, listening well, and fully respecting the needs and wishes of those you are helping.','I spent ten years with my head buried in Arabic grammar books and taught myself the language, which resulted in my volunteering as a refugee rights translator. I travelled to Turkey so that I could meet Afro-Turks, and helped them document events that they started or participated in for use in their identity preservation archive.','My friend Dave Onion who started a newspaper called the Defenestrator and runs a website of the same name. His main passion is computer programming in such a way that inspires community empowerment. ','Sam Darko, my younger brother who is 19. He\'s aspired to become a professional rapper, and is questioning his need for corporate resources to accomplish his goals. It\'s my personal belief that learning the ins-and-outs of the music industry and countering it by creating your own pathway is inspiring in its subversiveness. I mentor him on promotional strategy, networking, and how to maintain a positive mental attitude.','Mustafa Olpak, a Turkish activist based in Izmir, Turkey whose family roots are in Africa. I met him when I went to the town to learn more about the Afro-Turk community there. He has spent most of his time collecting old family photos and documents from all of the Afro-Turks to create a historical archive so that their old and recent existence is preserved. ','That my foreign language communication skills are fairly top-notch for someone who has been mostly self-taught. What made this comment special is that I\'ve been told that others have been inspired to teach themselves languages, too.','I feel that heritage preservation is an overlooked priority in the radical/progressive community. Children from immigrant families may not have the educational resources or even drive to master their parent\'s native tongue, and because of this, the link to familial tradition gradually dies out. Language and dialect  is one pro-active avenue that can be taken to preserve heritage so that it can be passed down and its beauty shared with others. ','A handful of language apps (and websites) exist. And yet, none actually push you to acquire the language skills of your cultural family based on mutual interests shared with others abroad. Plug in heritage, dialect, age range, etc. Then the interest, auto-selected from profiles when narrowing down a partner, will provide the contextual basis for conversations. You would also have the freedom to learn language(s) outside of your heritage, as well. ','I take advantage of Instagram to visually archive what happens in my life and community so that the subject can be accessible to . I\'ve often thought of improvements such as including a \"search by shared interest\" function (not just hashtags since they direct to specific photos), in a way that it analyzes your profile description, as well as a mixture of your friends most discussed interests, thus making it easier to build community.

While I have no aspiration of pursuing a permanent career in retail, as he did, I admire the amount of knowledge and insight that he is able to convey to his employees. However, I am a visual learner, and that is where I feel we differ. While he prefers to lead through instruction, I prefer to lead by doing.','\"Keep your head up, and never say no to an opportunity\". I feel, as an individual, it is important that we take our futures into our own hands. Throughout my life I have seen people turn down so many opportunities out of fear and laziness. This is good advice, to me at least, because I want to break a cycle of mediocrity that has lead to so many simply accepting \"the status quo\".','Financial literacy and risk management. Not having these skills, and with current public educational funding policies, receiving a sound education in these very important aspects of life is not likely. This problem must be solved as we move into the future, failing to do so could lead to the further desolation of the economic well being of the African-American community as it continues to grow.','I would create a database that would calculate the best course of action for a given scenario by analyzing the risks of certain actions, versus the possible outcomes based on historical data.

I admire Phillip\'s humility and self reflection. He is constantly sharing with everyone about what he is doing and how he is learning from his mistakes and successes. I have a tendency to reflect to myself and believe this is helping me grown and this creates a disconnect between me and my peers because I forget about that link, to connect my growth and lessons with that of those around me.','Do not be afraid to speak up. This was good because I found myself staying quiet about important things because I thought that made me humble. Sometimes there has to be a person in the room who is not afraid to point out the elephant in the room. One cannot be afraid of being that person.','Computer Literacy. This hinders people from being able to access opportunities in different arenas via the internet. My parents do not know how to use a computer, so things that seem simple like college applications and websites, are things that they do not know how to navigate. As a result of this there are many families that do not get the job and education opportunities afforded to others. This is part of busting the school to prison pipeline.','A person would be able to go to this program to be connected with different organizations/groups/churches/people in their area to get whatever help they need.

I am ethnically Mexican and Vietnamese. ','I am currently working as a health promotion specialist at API Wellness Center. I provide culturally competent HIV testing and counseling services and implement Project 4PLAY. The latter includes conducting outreach to at-risk populations for HIV infection and implementing an HIV prevention curricula for queer young men of color. This includes mentoring and empowering a cohort of young men to be critical and cognizant of their sexual health.','Conducting research on HIV/AIDS at UCLA and working as an HIV counselor in SF has provided me with a two-pronged understanding of HIV/AIDS and the institutions that combat it. Yet interfacing with clients has identified several gaps in my skills set.The most notable is developing applications that can be utilized to access at-risk clients. The Code for Progress (CFP) program will assist me in translating community specific needs into concrete applications.','I want to enter graduate school and intervene in the field of digital humanities. In this capacity, I would be able to apply my past experience as peer mentor in order to reach students of color that are often pushed out of the STEM majors. I would like to refine my skill set in coding before adventuring into the field of digital humanities. This means working for a community-based organization that will give me the space to develop my skill set.\r\n','Dr. Arthur Little was my faculty mentor who mentored me throughout my research and into the graduate admission process. But he did much more than that. He was the only queer faculty of color in a department still entrenched in solely espousing Chaucer and Milton. He taught me about queerness and how to translate my identity into social action. I learned how to extract the atmospheric ideas of literature and theory into tangible social realities.  ','His mentorship resulted in my dedication to creating knowledge from the margins and sharing that information to the community. I published and presented my research at symposiums and plan to take the conversations from his office hours into the realm of digital media. I continue to ask critical questions and mentor a cohort of queer men of color about asserting autonomy, understanding sexual health and navigating the health system.  ','I am in the process of identifying several people in my networks that would nurture my professional and intellectual development. One of these people is Tom from the Department of Public Health in SF. He is developing a project that is mapping HIV infections in SF and then using the projected data to identify community interventions. Data collection is one of my interests and I feel that he would support me since he trained me in HIV testing. ','I continue to mentor Matt even though I am no longer a peer learning facilitator at UCLA. I assist him in navigating UCLA and helping him manage his personal and academic well-being. Like me, he is a first-generation Latino student that is struggling to adjust to UCLA\'s culture. I encouraged him to join MeCha and create a space where he can develop his interests. He is about to leave the U.S. for the first time and study Chinese in the fall. ','I admire the project director of my grant because he is a fierce advocate for the API community. His advocacy has led in part to the survival of our program in a climate that continues to perpetuate the model minority myth. He speaks as a hardened AIDS survivor of the 1980s and its this indomitable trait that separates our styles. His assertiveness is effective but off-putting. I hope to improvise and articulate the urgency of his advocacy style.','One mentor mentioned that my introverted personality can be misconstrued as passive and complacent. This critique was helpful in identifying how I can assert my ideas and revise the misconceptions about me. In meetings, I have played on my academic strengths and now take the initiative to present research articles. This moment helped me realize that people of color often refuse to take up space. Now every time I speak, I am reclaiming space for myself. ','Most gay sexual encounters have migrated from the public sphere to the digital arena. This new change in hookup culture has not been addressed in the field of HIV prevention and as a result, HIV infections continue to rise for queer people of color. Most outreach efforts occur in bars and clubs because there is no set protocol on how to harness social media while conducting outreach. This narrow focus has neglected a newfound landscape transformed by apps.','The program that I would design would allow an outreach worker to organize and compile all their online contacts from different social media and app platforms. Often during online outreach, the worker is bewildered when they have to balance 30 conversations across different platforms. The program would put all the contacts into one space and help systematize whether the outreach message is being effectively communicated. \r\n',' I use Adam4Adam, an explicit hook-up website that is often used by gay men. Along with other hook-up applications, A4A allows you to locate potential partners and disaggregate by characteristics but it does not have a sexual health resources tab that is integrated into the page. One method for improvement would be to allow an agency to certify online a person\'s HIV status. This would encourage routine testing, link users to healthcare, and help partners. ','Outside of work, I spend my time helping my mom take care of my two younger siblings. Their father is often absent due to his work, which often leads to me doing my best paternal improvisation. Due to work, I now read novellas over novels. When the opportunity arises, I assist in volunteering for the Gay Straight Alliance program in high school. Working with queer youth activists is always reinvigorating and has taught me about leadership and community.','5','4','5','3','4','2','4','2','1','3','3','1',NULL,'None','None','None','None','None','None','Duc ','Tran','dtt131@gmail.com','408-674-9329','Duc was a participant in the group that I implement for Asian & Pacific Islander Wellness Center.

','This training will connect me with a team of people who are passionate about using computer programming for community development. As a student in policy school, I rarely have the opportunity to connect with students studying computer science, and so this would provide me a network and channel where I can collaborate with people with different skill sets but similar goals in regard to social justice.','I plan to find employment in the transportation planning industry, and then work towards earning my PhD in Urban Planning. ','Shawn, my roommate and best friend during my undergraduate years, showed me first-hand the difficulties for an African American male to find employment in today\'s job market. He was unable to be employed, even though we both went to the same private university. Seeing this, I learned that justice is less concerned with creating an equal playing field and more concerned with remedying systematic prejudice. ','Since the prejudice exists with all racial groups, I decided to present Asian-Americans, specifically in the Chinese and Vietnamese communities. I\'m involved with justice and want to fix the way our media portrays Asian-Americans, specifically in type-casted roles that require martial arts. ','I would ask to be mentored by my friend Luke, a friend that I know from high school. His experience as a cross-country runner and as a Marine has taught him a great amount of endurance, both mental and physical. I really admire people who never stop, who don\'t give up half way. Luke is that type of person and he exemplifies a quality that I\'d like to possess. ','Although I don\'t consider it an official mentorship, I do serve as a mentor to Andy, my 7 year old brother. I mentor him as a role model, because I know he constantly compares himself to me. Specifically, I teach him how to play video games; Minecraft is his current obsession. I also keep him updated with pop culture news.','My style of leadership is very direct, blunt and stoic; which is very different from that of my friend Justin. I admire Justin\'s leadership because it\'s emotionally intelligent. It considers the feelings of other people. Justin is the type of person who thinks before he speaks, so he chooses his words wisely. I respect that because a good leader possesses emotional self-awareness in order to manage the emotions of others.','\"I don\'t get it\" was the best criticism I\'ve gotten. It came from a professor who had just finished listening to my presentation. The experience made me realize that when communicating to others, you have to meet them halfway. Many presenters speak with such bombast that they alienate their audience. What I learned from the critique is that when presenting, the goal is to make sure the audience understands your objective and gets it. ','Graffiti is a problem that affects the south Los Angeles area. It\'s important to solve because a solution requires finding a balance between allowing artistic expression while enforcing community regulation.','My app would provide a map of designated places where graffiti is allowed and not allowed. Graffiti artists, who are looking for a place to show their art, would go on their phones or computers to find out which areas are available. Business owners who are looking for public art to be displayed on their walls could provide permission for graffiti art to be painted, given that they have permission from the landlord. ','PeopleAdmin, the talent management system USC, currently offers a number of different user types for hiring managers. This creates a hierarchal culture where people do not feel like they are on the same level as others. One way it could be improved is if we simplified the user types to just one user or two user types so that there is less focus on what kind of access you have and more emphasis on teamwork and coordination.','Playing piano\r\nHanging out with friends\r\nBeing a student (studying, class, library, etc.)','5','5','5','5','5','5','5','5','5','5','5','3',NULL,'4','3','2','4','2','4',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,'I am attending the University of Southern California as a candidate for a masters in urban planning and a masters in public policy.

I was in his \"Credit Catch-up\" class and he was the type of coach the whole school loved. After his rein of 25years he was arrested for stealing $30,000 from the football\'s fundraising program and was no longer allowed to teach. I use him as an example because this was the guy that I heard give the \"Money is the root of all evil speech\" to one of my other peers.','After finding out about all of his dirty deeds back in \'12, I began to re-evaluate my own moral compass. I never want to appear as someone that can\'t match his personality/morals to the actions he commits. I specifically remember one time in his class when we were having a discussion about race and with the most sinister look on his face he said, \"I LIKE BEING WHITE.\" So everyday I practice telling myself that I will never be blinded by the money.','Dirk Wiggins is someone who\'s been around my brother and I since our early years in grade school. Truly someone I want to ask to mentor me but I feel as if he\'s already doing it without doing much.','I have two younger brothers(9&15yrs old) that I try to mentor. Even though we didn\'t have the BEST upbringing,  I want to show them how to not let it affect their view on life and others around them. Whenever I catch them doing something wrong I correct them in a polite manner and give them examples on why my perspective is just. Also, by taking them out to the batting cages or any other team building activity we can make that brotherhood bond stronger.','One of Barack Obama\'s leadership styles I admire is the way he shows emotion through his speeches. He has the ability to captivate everyone\'s attention with the tone of his voice. This is a trait I strive for myself because I grew up a quiet kid that always had plenty to say. The only way our styles differ is that I like to let my actions to the talking.','One piece was that I have the potential to exceed in something great but I lack the drive. Given the circumstances I currently live in I took this criticism and made a mental note on who I really wanted to become regardless of the situation.','Ever since social networks started targeting the younger generation we have seen an enormous amount of growth with bullying. Cyber-bullying has been responsible for numerous amounts of crimes and even suicides. This is an issue that requires immediate attention because is causes a chain reaction and more and more kids are prone to developing low self-esteem.','Alright so this program would be used in a way most people use their daily journals. The worst thing anyone could do in the midst of a bully attack is not tell anyone about it. So we record every incident in a log and offer therapeutic exercises to help ease the pain of the victim. It\'s basically for the proper authorities to have all the evidence they need to charge someone in an easy to pull up profile. ','One way that Twitter could be improved is by having the option to filter out content.

Moody-Mills\'s work and having heard her speak on a number of panels, I have come to respect her views on culture, specifically on where race and gender intersect. I have approached her after several panels for questions and conversation, so the next step would be to ask her advice on how to think critically and logically about critiquing culture.','I\'d never thought of it as a mentoring relationship, but I met a college student on Twitter who is freshly out of the closet. He has since transferred to University of Maryland, and we meet semi-regularly to talk about what the process has been like for him. I also try to give him advice about navigating the gay scene in DC and New York City, hoping that he can avoid the many pitfalls that I got caught in.','My manager at LivingSocial, Blake, led with a firm hand and without being very personable. This was completely unlike any other manager I\'d had, but she has helped me sharpen my editorial skills better than any other person since college. When managing freelance writers, I learned to combine her intensity and severe attention to detail with a more personable attitude, which got a better response from writers working remotely.','In college, I was so interested in close reading that I would be lost when trying to fit a word or sentence into its larger context. A professor eventually told me \"You\'re so busy staring at a grain of sand that you don\'t realize you\'re standing in a desert.\" Keeping this note in mind has been vital going forward, so that I remember that nothing I write or study exists in a vacuum, and not acknowledging context is a huge mistake.','The county I grew up in, Prince George\'s County, has the highest dropout rate in Maryland, aside from Baltimore City. I can think of more than a dozen students who graduated with me who were functionally illiterate, my cousin included. These students will struggle to complete any job application they come across, and will likely remain in poverty. Great minds are going to waste because public education has failed to properly equip and prepare them.','I would love to create a site that offers free seminars, courses, and one-on-one tutoring for students who want to improve their reading and writing skills. Since No Child Left Behind is STILL enforced, children in low-income areas will continue to be set up for failure, and they need as much supplemental help as possible.','I use Tweetbot to access Twitter from my iPhone. It is easily the best Twitter app I have used; it has great customization options and is the only app that allows the user to mute certain phrases and topics, which has proven very useful. Though, it becomes cumbersome when the user wants to switch between accounts. If it could switch accounts more seamlessly, I feel that more people would use Tweetbot than TweetDeck.','Reading and writing take up most of my day and have been major factors in my life since before I entered preschool. Every job I have had has focused on reading and writing, and I spend most of my free time doing one or the other. I also spend a lot of time learning about drag by going to shows, interviewing queens, and thinking about how drag has been an integral part of gay liberation.','5','5','5','5','5','4','5','5','2','5','5','1',NULL,'4','2','1','1','1','1','Phil','Crehan','phil.crehan@gmail.com','443-280-3284','Phil has been a close friend since entering college together in 2006.','Blake','Joseph','blakegernstetter@gmail.com','917-921-8056','Blake was my manager at LivingSocial.','Tymon','Francis','tymon06@gmail.com','703-994-5279','Tymon and I worked closely on projects and promotions while working at LivingSocial.

He saw that I wanted to do big things but had to focus on the smaller steps to develop those goals into reality. This was some of the best criticism I have ever received because it made me slow down and think about process more in everyday goals and led me to achieving my goals more often.','Homeless individuals in Madison, Wisconsin often do not fully understand resources at their disposal.

I am interested in Code for Progress because sophisticated digital organizing amplifies voices often left unheard. Improving my tech skillset will make me a more effective organizer. ','I have been especially active in political campaigns and community service initiatives. In urban areas like New York City, standard organizing techniques are less effective since it is hard to get into buildings, and people move frequently. Online digital organizing would allow me to better connect activists with other members in the community. Further, I could reach significantly more people in the community with a sophisticated online presence.  ','I plan to work as a Community Liaison in a city councilmember’s office. I find that at the most local levels of government there is a great need for technology and better methods of keeping up with the needs of constituents, especially those in marginalized communities. I dream of being able to better organize tenants dealing with bad landlords or parents who wanted to be updated on school performance, and other local concerns. ','My father was a brilliant man weakened by inexplicable cruelties. From cancer to heart disease to diabetes to hip replacements, his body was no match for his mind. Yet through his fight to live, a fight he lost in 2010, I learned that life is not defined by adversity, but courage in the face of it. He taught me that one can do everything right, but still end up in a terrible situation. I learned that the protection of the vulnerable is a pillar of justice.','I will change society so the pain my family endured is made more gentle on others.  I worked on progressive campaigns: Howard Dean, John Kerry, Carol Shea-Porter, Deval Patrick, Barack Obama, Cory Booker, Bill de Blasio, and several New York City Council campaigns. As a public finance analyst I completed over $3 billion in infrastructure projects. I serve on Teach for America’s Young Professional Committee and am a mentor in the A Better Chance program. ','When I was in college I had the chance to meet Seth Bannon, the co-founder of Amicus. It is a startup which helps organizations digitally connect with supporters. I have been very impressed in his steps in bringing digital organizing to many groups from labor unions to colleges.

','I am an extrovert who loves to talk and laugh and get to know people. I can stand up strongly for what I believe in and I have no problem speaking or debating in front of a room of hundreds of people. Senator Harry Reid has a quieter disposition. I admire how Sen. Reid achieved important victories such as immigration reform or unemployment insurance extensions with very few speeches and a quiet yet determined resolve. ','There was once a time when I was a micro-manager. I wanted to check up on every little detail when I managed a team. A mentor told me this restrained those on my team, but if I gave them more freedom to complete their assignments we would be more effective. This advice was so good because it made me a better leader and greatly accelerated my projects. I learned that a great leader must give trustworthy and capable individuals space to have impact. ','Many city or county websites look like they were designed in the 1990s and have limited functionality. Candidates’ websites are often far more sophisticated than those of the offices they seek. It is difficult for people to report an uptick in crime in their neighborhood or see how their child’s school ranks against state averages. There are many dedicated elected officials, but if problems are not effectively communicated it is hard to fix them.','I propose an open source dashboard that would keep people informed and involved in their local communities. Crime, infrastructure issues, and environmental problems could be reported. Voter registration and education courses like MOOCs would be available. A user would simply visit their city’s or county’s website and use a Facebook log-in to access their dashboard. The elected official’s staff could thus more efficiently perform constituent services.','The iPhone’s photo app could be improved by adding a text-based search feature. For example, if you search “green,” photos with green hues would appear. Services such as TinEye’s Reverse Image Search can identify similar images, so if there were a database of common images, we might have the beginnings of a text-based image search. Further, if we could create a way to tag photos with text, then these descriptions would make image searching more efficient.','I love to play speed chess because of the combination of deep strategic thought and the thrill of time pressure.

I have a passion for math education but unfortunately did not have the opportunity to study math and computer science in college, as I learned about my undocumented status during high school and decided to study social structures to better understand the power dynamics of our world and become an advocate for immigrant rights on campus and in my community. ','I have 2 jobs, one as an in class algebra tutor in a middle school and the other as a private math tutor with over 5 years of experience. I work with students from all ages and backgrounds, from kindergarten to community college, wealthy and low income families, that allow me to see the resources available but also the disparities between both worlds.  ','This training will provide me with the necessary tools to make an innovative and interactive bridge between math/technology education and social justice issues. I believe that teaching coding and showing students how to create tools/apps for themselves is a great asset to math education. Complimenting computer science education with computer based math education is something I hope to achieve, so that students can create instead of simply consume. ','I want to be a math teacher in an urban setting, preferably in high school age group. I believe this profession will allow me to mentor members of my community as well as challenge my students to think about STEM education as something that can be applied to their everyday lives. I believe that this profession will also challenge me to stay up to date with new technologies. ','My mother and my teachers have taught me about justice. They have taught me that every human being should fight for their dignity and that there is no justice unless everyone\'s dignity is respected. They have taught me to help others when I have the opportunity, but also to take care of myself. They have taught me to respect others and their opinions, to understand that everyone on this planet is worth something and that everyone has something to offer. ','As a math tutor I have tried to practice what I have learned from my teachers and my mother by respecting all of my students. By treating them with respect, I can earn their trust and build a better learning environment with them. It is also important for me to remember that every student I tutor and mentor has something to offer, regardless of their backgrounds, and that I can also learn from them everyday. ','I would like to be mentored by a popular education scholar who would allow me to share my passion for math and integrate it social justice issues. I think that a lot of people shy away from the perceived hierarchical approach to STEM education, and it is one of my goals to make math more accessible for everyone, including those who think math is hard or not for them. I believe that through popular education, math education can be more collaborative. ','I currently mentor my 14 year old cousin and 8th grade Algebra students in an urban school in downtown Los Angeles. I try to model myself as someone who is passionate about math and science but also social justice. I think this is important because often we are made to believe that we must choose one or the other. I talk to them about making sure they see university as an option, challenge them academically, and ask them to care for their communities. ','At UCLA I was co-chair of IDEAS, the undocumented student support and advocacy organization on campus. My other co-chair was very outspoken and great at public speaking, while I was more reserved and preferred sharing my ideas in small groups. That experience challenged me to be more confident when expressing my opinions and allowed me to practice my public speaking, but I also learned to embrace my soft-spoken style of leadership as an active listener.','An excellent piece of constructive criticism I\'ve gotten was from a friend who told me that sometimes I can be too nice and quiet, which could be interpreted as being passive. Before that, I would agree with someone even if I did not share their opinion simply because I did not want to be disrespectful. This advice helped me be more direct when sharing my opinions and ideas while attempting to respect others at the same time. ','I believe a huge problem that affects people in underrepresented communities (particularly low-income, immigrant communities) is that they do not have access to innovative learning styles, tools, and technologies in their schools and communities. I think that it is important to have skills that allow members of our communities to create tools that help them solve the problems themselves instead of waiting for an outside party to help them. ','As a future math educator I would like to teach my students how they can create their own apps and also build a social networking app that would allow them to form study groups, share resources about college, and ask questions about a topic or profession in a safe space where professionals or current college students can answer them or share resources where students can find answers to their questions. More than anything, this app must be fun to use. ','Risking being cliche, I believe Facebook can be improved in ways that can help users become involved in their communities. Perhaps facilitating a process where a reminder would be sent to all of my friends about volunteer opportunities in a specific date, either using their location or my location. Groups and event pages can be created to get the word out today, but it is a tedious process that can often discourage people from sharing more opportunities','I believe it is important to find a balance between learning, enjoying life, and helping others. I like to spend my time reading, meditating and listening to music, and tutoring math to people of all ages. I also find that constantly working on having healthy relationships with family and friends is important to build a support system when times are tough. Living a peaceful life and having peace of mind is also a priority for me.

I believe the Arts are a medium for inspiration, and value that power over financial gain.','I would ask Emanuel Pleitez, whom I worked for in 2013 during the final month of his unsuccessful Mayoral campaign in Los Angeles. We are the same age, yet his ability to master both technology and business concepts impresses me greatly.\r\n\r\nWe still keep contact, and I use him as a professional reference.

Sara exudes a passion for her work through everything she does, which is highly contagious. She is very thorough, with a keen eye for detail and an energy that never seems exhausted.\r\n\r\nOur styles in leadership differ mainly through presentation style. While we both convey material successfully, she does so with more of a pleasing spirit than I do. I find her highly inspirational.','I was once told, after a couple of weeks of success in recruiting organizers, not to get comfortable with my own accomplishments. While I struggled initially to comprehend why I was being told this during a period of increase, I realized that I was not optimizing my own and others\' capabilities. I used this piece of advice as a springboard, which pushed me through the final weeks of that campaign.

I think this applicable to far more than starting a new job. It\'s important to listen.','The problems are numerous for every organization. One thing that I notice, being in the field of politics, is how hard it is for the average citizen to see, understand, and be able to really get what goes on during the legislative process.

Our rural schools tend to only teach the disciplines that are deemed \"absolutely necessary\" and while its clear that our communities would benefit from the education, civics seem to be a thing of the past. Our society all too easily writes off communities that are off the beaten path and don\'t show potential in population. This is my reality... my community.','I am working in the hospitality industry for a Ski Resort in the rural, western mountains of Maine. I recently moved back from Oregon to rest my soul for a minute before heading back into the fast paced world of politics. Currently, I work mountainside as a bartender, diligently paying my student loans and enjoying the crisp snow.','I would like to utilize this training to provide a service to my state. Many highly educated students flee the state of Maine after they\'ve obtained a degree or certification. The tech industry has the capacity to blossom here, but there are not enough local, qualified candidates to sustain these companies. Outsourcing has been implemented to fill the void. I would like to see this change to provide more training and jobs to state residents.','I plan to seek employment with a political campaign, as well as offering volunteer services to non-profits specializing in Juvenile Rights activism.','My supervisor, Kari Rieck, from CASA- Court Appointed Special Advocates (Voices for Children) taught me some of life\'s greatest lessons about justice. We worked with children that were \"in the system.\" Working with abused and neglected children is difficult to say the least. Kari taught me to know the law as I would one of \"our\" kiddos. Understand, be patient with, and trust the law. Persistence and passion will prevail. ','People that commit crimes against children are often in denial. They constantly find loop-holes and excuses to deny accountability. I regularly studied the laws of my field, attended seminars and educational classes to further my knowledge on the cases and subjects I was dealing with. Through passion and determination I found the ability inside myself to be patient with, trust, understand, and love the law- thus producing positive results.','I would ask Jon Puglsey. Jon is currently the campaign manager for an Oregon congressman, but above all he is my friend. I worked side by side with Jon during the first campaign I ran in 2012. Jon was my encouragement and cheerleader every step of the way. He pushed me to find answers rather than be told. He forced me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow. I trust and respect Jon. It would be an honor to have him as my mentor.','I mentor my younger brother. I show him support when he needs strength to persevere and I do not condemn him nor encourage him when I disapprove of his actions. I push myself to become a better role model to him by sharing both my negative and positive experiences with him. I explain how I did things to get to the positive places I find myself and I review my mistakes when I stumble upon a place less fruitful. I like to lead through love and example.','Our staunch party holding (incumbent) opponent in 2012 was well integrated into the community. Naturally, I loathed him but I highly admired his likability. Full of energy and charisma, he was a real charmer. He had led by being a \"pal,\" rather than focusing on the issues. Unfortunately, it worked for our misguided community. While I would say I possess charm, I am a behind the scenes girl due to my lack of these chameleon-like qualities. ','\"Slow and steady wins the race.\"\r\nI have a tendency to get way too ahead of myself. When you\'re going a million miles a minute, details can go overlooked. In my field, details will make or break you. A calming voice has said to me on more than one occasion... \"Slow and steady wins the race.\" Sometimes a simple reminder to slow down can make a world of difference. ','Apathy towards local government due to lack of readily accessible information. People care about government but develop apathy after years of being conditioned that information is hard to dig up. People prefer Easy Street. Social media is vital to the success of most modern businesses and is under-used in local government due to lack of know-how. National government has figured this out, the local guys need to follow suit to regain interest. ','Standard computer applications are, for the most part, already in place to show a digital calendar of events and meetings. Local branches have a tendency to be digitally illiterate and it is made obvious by their poorly created, and hard to navigate websites. Activities and meetings of public interest should be readily available in a user-friendly mobile app. Modern publishing will spark conversation, generate interest and insight community involvement.','The iPhone 5s is one of the most intelligent devices ever produced for the general public. One of my almost-favorite new features is \"contact linking.\" This allows the owner to edit their contacts so that they can be linked with affiliated people. However, this linking feature is confusing. Once you link people together they are all attached and share a phone number. This needs to be revisited so that you can find them under a list option instead.','I enjoy living a comfortable lifestyle and my family has never been wealthy enough to provide that for me. So... I work... a lot. Whether it\'s politics or bartending, I\'m constantly on the move. Next to working I network. I use my time to gain knowledge, friendships and career strategies by reaching out to people. I attend community events, and introduce myself often. Leftover free time you\'ll find me catching up on my world news via tv, web, & newspaper.','5','5','5','3','4','4','4','3','1','3','3','2',NULL,'3','1','1','1','1','1','Jon ','Pugsley','oregonfieldguy@gmail.com','(541) 231-9427','Shared a campaign office','Claudia ','Baum','cskbaum@gmail.com','(503) 364-9741','Member of county party & campaign volunteer','Brad ','Witt','Rep.BradWitt@state.or.us','(503) 910-3415','State Representative, campaign endorser',1,'I have obtained my BA in English and a minor in Professional Communication from the University of Maine.

It is a very difficult time for women in Texas concerning women\'s health, so I believe it is important to empower people and organizations with the tools to get Texas moving in the right direction. ','I am a Research and Public Policy Intern at Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) and a Senior Fellow at Battleground Texas (BGTX). At ROC, I am assisting with a study on Houston\'s restaurant industry in an attempt to improve the conditions of restaurant workers. At BGTX, I lead meetings with volunteers, identify and develop neighborhood team leaders, and I use the Voter Activation Network (VAN). ','During my formative education, computer science was very basic, and classes seemed to be targeted at boys. I am very data driven, able to do complex analyses on SPSS/PASW, but I do not know much about things like coding. I believe that data and technology is vital for the progressive movement, and, unfortunately, it is not used enough. We want to help people, but we need the tools to empirically show what works and what doesn\'t. ','I would like to work for a political or non-profit organization dedicated to social justice. I come from a very progressive background, and I want to use my education and research skills in order to make these types of organizations more effective in order to improve the lives of the under-respresented.  ','My mom took me to my first protest when I was 11. When I was  13, she took me to a conference about the dangers of the far right. She volunteered nights on the Rape Crisis Hotline and escorted survivors through picket lines at Planned Parenthood. Even though she is in her 60\'s, last year she was arrested for civil disobedience. She taught me to be brave, to be aware, to stand up for myself and others, and that it is our responsibility to give back. ','Although also rewarding, instead of pursuing a career in academia, I want to work in an applied setting where I can actively be involved in change and social justice. I think this is reflected in my current internship and fellowship.','I might want to ask the Data Director for Battleground Texas to mentor me. She has worked on several campaigns and is the person behind the numbers at Battleground. I think effective organizations needs to be data driven, and I think she would be able to give me insight on how an organization uses data to bring about change. ','I am mentoring my volunteers at Battleground Texas. I teach them about the organization, get them trained, and teach them how to use VAN. I hope that I also effectively deliver the message to take the high road when dealing with people of differing opinions. If Texas is going to change, it is going to change by organizations like Battleground being effective, not by bickering with people. ','I admire Adrienne Bell, the Regional Field Director for Battleground Texas. She is very direct and is very firm about asking people for things. I lead groups, but I also try to have meetings with my group to get a consensus on what should be done. I think people feel valued by this, but sometimes it can take longer. I think that sometimes people just want to be given a task by someone else, and she is very good at this. She is very authoritative. ','I can be too critical of myself. I think this comes from a very strict French school system where students were more often criticized than praised. When I worked at a law firm, I rated myself lower on a performance assessment than all of the attorneys rated me. One of the attorneys told me to give myself more credit for my skills. People need to be mindful of their accomplishments instead of only focusing on their deficits. ','I live in a low socio-economic area. A lot of my neighbors rely heavily on various social services and resources, such as food banks and WIC health centers, but they don\'t know what is available. For instance, an elderly woman was living without electricity and didn\'t know about an organization that helps seniors with bills until I told her. Another neighbor didn\'t know about any upcoming food banks. It is important to know to help their quality of life. ','One could create an app that links up with social services and resources available for the poor, elderly, handicapped, etc. One could select from choices such as the age of the person (e.g. help for seniors or children), the issue (e.g., food, healthcare, utilities, transportation), and the zip code. After entering the information, the person would get a list regarding the closest available options for them. ','I have a Walgreens app to make ordering prescriptions more convenient. Since it stores a list of one\'s prescriptions and doses, I think it would be great if one had the option of setting an alarm or notification through the app to remind people when to take their medicine. My brother has brain damage, so it is hard for him to remember when to take his numerous medications. This would really help him. ','I probably spend most of my time on my internship and fellowship. We foster dogs, so I spend the a lot time on them (Houston has a huge problem with strays, so someone is always looking for a new home). Third would probably be reading (I am a huge book lover, so I try to find time every day).

In college, especially upon reading de Tocqueville, I found myself increasingly aware of the importance of civic engagement in democratic societies.  Unfortunately, I have not given myself enough opportunities to exercise this new-found awareness, and hope that through Code for Progress I will be able to become a better citizen who effectively serves his community and country.','I am unsure as of yet.','If \"real\" can refer to people dead and distant, then I have learned most about justice from Plato, Kant, Rawls, and Dworkin. The idea that the exercise of justice transcends mundane considerations (such as personal pleasure) and constitutes the highest form of human living, is one I find deeply moving.\r\n\r\nIf \"real\" instead refers only to people I personally know, then I would say my peers who worked with me at the University of Chicago\'s Splash! program.  ','Splash! is a student-run program wherein undergraduates create classes and teach them to and for high school students. There are splash programs at Stanford and MIT, but unlike those programs, the University of Chicago primarily serves high school students from the inner-city. I would argue that the United States\' education system has failed these students. Some of my students even had difficulty reading. I have participated in this program many times. ','At my university there is a professor I particularly admire: Professor Martha Nussbaum. She works primarily in political philosophy, law, feminism, and ethics. She has written many influential and cogent works on sexuality, social justice, liberalism, and tolerance. Furthermore, unlike many of her colleagues, she actively participates in political life, especially in development economics. She is very busy and important, but I\'d like to ask her.','As a teacher at the University of Chicago\'s Splash! program, I have mentored a number of students. I have taught and helped co-teach classes in ethics, theology, philosophy, and music. I have found the experience very rewarding, and have received positive feedback from my students. I find this especially satisfying, seeing as many of these students tragically feel alienated from their education system and from intellectual life in general.','I admire tolerant and patient leaders. I have met a large number of such times in my time: pragmatists who are concerned with getting work done, but doing it together with the people they are in charge of. When I lead, whether it be a classroom or a discussion, I tend to become more interested in details, nuances, paradoxes, and exceptions. This tends to slow work down to a snail\'s pace.','To be more considerate of others. This is good advice, because it is always good advice.','Computer programs deal in information, so naturally computer applications are best suited to solving questions that pertain to the propagation of information. I find that there is quite a large set of information that many citizens are unaware of. Social services, health services, career opportunities, educational opportunities... quite a lot of these programs a made, but then not made accessible because they are not widely known.

It\'s important to solve this problem so that people can progress from poverty, increase home-ownership,and business development.','The program would encourage a year of planning and financial growth for individuals and their family.

I know this isn\'t a social justice thing, but I have used some of my life experience to help him.','One of the first organizers I worked under during the 2008 Obama campaign had a somewhat hands off leadership style, setting goals and expectations and allowing those under him to figure out their own ways to accomplish them. My style has always been more hands on and intimate. His style allowed for more flexibility and innovation and has been something that I have tried to integrate into my own organizing work in subsequent campaigns and projects.','When I first delved into organizing I was told by my boss that I should take more of an interest in our volunteers lives outside of the campaign. It builds a stronger connection with the people you are relying on to do much of the work of the campaign and helps them know you value them. It\'s amazing how much good a simple question like, \"Hey, how were those grandkids this weekend?\" can do for a volunteer-organizer relationship.','Speaking as someone who has lived his life outside of areas which have a strong base of activism and community involvement, it is often hard to find organizations or groups of like-minded people in places like this who are available to work on any of the problems we are concerned about. This leads to feelings of disempowerment and disconnection from the community around us.','I can envision an app focused on rural and less served areas that allow people to suggest areas of improvement and either organize around those issues or connect with organizations which already exist. This would have elements of social networking, possibly wiki-style information gathering/sharing, and ideally, incentives for people to get involved and active enough to actually accomplish things locally.','I use Facebook a lot to connect with friends and like-minded people, but it usually isn\'t very useful beyond sharing items of interest with people who already agree with you and general communication with people on your friends list. I would like to see something that could facilitate real discussion that wouldn\'t devolve into angry arguments and elements that could be better geared towards actually accomplishing things, rather than just talking about them','Before I had to drop out, school took up much of my time.

I want to work to develop large-scale programs and initiatives within the realm of disability and I think this would be a great agency to work for.  Also, if I was able to get better educated on how the gov\'t can better interact and educate the private sector, then I might understand the direct relationship at play between the industries. ','There is a young woman who works as a cashier in my building.  I met with her and she told me about her interest in going back to school (she had graduated HS but did not have her BA).  I put together a folder with information for the local community college and their advising center, including information for the 4-year guarantee college admission program.  She just enrolled last week and is on her way to getting her degree! Empowerment through education!','A former supervisor.  A former supervisor was a non-nonsense, end-game in mind, take no prisoners type of person.  I, on the other hand, and more of a buy-in, collaboration, and \"let\'s communicate\" type of individual.

','\"Remember, your mother is a school aide.\"  This was one of the best pieces of advise I have gotten because it made me realize that everyone within a company is a human being and deserves a sense of respect, from the janitors to the CEO.  Interestingly, it was my own mother who made this statement to me the first time she visited me in NYU and noticed I didn\'t greet the security guards when I left the building.   ','There are hundred of resources available for people with disabilities and hundreds of agencies that are able to provide said services.  There is much disenfranchisement within the disabled community because the people who need resources don\'t know where to go to get them, and then agencies that can provide resources aren\'t trained appropriately on how to provide. It\'s important to solve this problem given rates of disability are growing exponentially.  ','A one-source-stop that can educate people who need disability services with information so that they can become self-informed on resources out there.  In addition to educating individuals, it would be critical to providing information on how to obtain the resources, the laws available (in plain language), a how-to-guide, samples of informations and letters. And then providing a similar resource to businesses that need information to change their practices.','Youtube is in serious need of a realistic closed captioning overhaul.

In result I understand french to a basic survival level.','I\'m really excited about this program because I’ve observed a huge absence of young Black women in the tech industry. As a Black, Queer, radical feminist I intersectionally connect with a spectrum of oppressed communities. The important analysis for me is that these communities have a disproportionately limited access to educational tools, technology, and data/research. I want to shift the paradigm by providing these resources in the affected areas.',' I currently work with the Black Youth Project as a lead organizer building for three projects: Black on Both Sides, BYP100, and Black Thought Black Action. I’m also a youth legal advocate with the Know Your Rights Campaign in Chicago. We teach young people how to navigate encounters with the police and to maintain an accessible knowledge of their rights in order to divert them from the funnel of mass incarceration. \r\n','Communities and organizations have a prevalent need for tech platforms, as well as the intensive instruction on how to harness the power of it. I want to pave a road for tech inclusion by transforming the peoples needs into a reality by creating apps and software that will streamline the work to be more efficient.  My dream is to pull grassroots organizing out of the prehistoric methods it uses for outreach, base-building, public awareness, and campaigns.','I want to enhance my skills in digital organizing by working for groups that are really successful at the craft. I’m an organizer by heart so my ideal work post-coding would  be to use the skills I’ve learned to amplify the work of Chicago campaigns.\r\n','I was first politicized and trained as an organizer by my mentor Charity Tolliver. I learned that justice itself was not a routine formula, and that it looks different for each person fighting for it. So victories in the fight for justice must be reflective of the people in struggle. In order to build power we must develop the most affected group into leaders and equip them with the skills to make the change they want to see in the world.','I’ve been very intentional about developing the young people I work with into organizers by cultivating a political analysis, training them on organizing skills and making sure the leaders of the work have access to all the tools they need to direct the movement work. It is imperative to me to have the resources available to build a foundation for the work that people want to do.\r\n','I’d really like to ask my national coordinator to mentor me, she has 10 years of experience in organizing on a national scale. My accomplishments have generally been at a local level. She also was the first person to introduce me to the idea of digitally organizing. Which has sparked me on the journey to acquire the tech skills to build on campaign ideas. I’m also really interested in learning advanced movement building skills that have been successful.','	I mainly am serving as a mentor through the youth groups that I work with. But I do this work knowing that in order to keep the social justice movement alive we must be training the next generation as we do this work. Specifically my youth apprentice David is interested in civil rights organizing & queer justice. So we research different issues involved and map organizations doing the work in Chicago. We work on organizing trainings & curriculum building.','My BYP comrade Jasson has a much more diplomatic and democratic approach in leadership. Its a really patient virtue that I need more of in my approach as a leader. It takes more time and much more debate on politics, values and how they align so that people at different ends of the political spectrum understand the importance of coalition. Because of my role as a teacher I\'m more used to influencing and shifting analysis to create a cohesive movement. \r\n','I was once told that I focus too much on correcting and perfecting established solutions to things, and that I should build my own solutions. It was the first day I realized that we are trained to identify and correct problems in a system, idea, or process. But true brilliance lives in the birth of new ideas and the capacity to build something from the nothing at all.\r\n','Mass Incarceration is enslaving people of color at disproportionate rates. The prison industrial complex has created a profitable system that is funneling our people from schools, foster care, hospitals and other institutions into the prison system. We have to deconstruct this system because it is unjust, corrupt and purely for the profit of the corporations invested. There are more restorative and transformative alternatives to policing and incarceration.','An app that would reduce the flow into the prison system by helping us to navigate the way that we interact with police on the streets. This app would give you a full understanding of each one of your rights as a youth, person of color, or member of the lgbtq community. It would also give you a direct number to the nearest free defense legal aid available in your area and a pre filled form of emergency information.','We use yelp to locate places usually for consumerist purposes, but when crisis happens we have  to hunt for resources & solutions to our needs. We need databases like Yelp to include locations for people to find immediate resources near them quickly. So that people have effortless access to shelters, food pantries, warming centers, free clinics, trauma centers, legal defenders and fresh food options. Making these resources more accessible will save lives.','I put most of my time into Black Youth Project and the three branches of movement development that we focus on. In Chicago there is a dire need to build & sustain spaces for Black organizing to be cultivated, because black youth and violence have become controversially synonymous terms. I also work on organizational growth & grant writing with other organizations.

Ideally, I would stay at HRC and work to help develop apps/resources to improve the lives of LGBT youth.','My father-elect, Jamie Washington was the first person to teach me about justice as both a personal & global concept. From him, I have learned: it is our responsibility to leave the world a little better than when we inherited it; self-justice (i.e. self-care) is necessary to do global justice (eliminating marginalization & hierarchy); it is the work you do, not the words you say that will affect change; just us is not justice.','Much of my work is focused on helping LGBTQ POC communities. To that end, I have: convened a transgender advisory council and created/produced issue-specific guides to help HBCUs navigate creating services for trans and gender non-conforming students; worked in multi-issue POC organizing campaigns (school-to-prison pipeline, LGBTQ justice, repro. rights, mass incarceration, food justice, etc); and begun developing webinars for LGBT POC youth leaders. ','I don\'t currently have access to anyone who codes and could serve as a mentor to me through this program. If having a mentor who codes isn\'t a requirement, I would ask Dr. Anika Simpson to mentor me. She has been in an incredible source of support for me. She challenges me to think deeply and broadly about issues while encouraging me to develop creative solutions. I trust her immensely.','As a former member of Rainbow Soul, my university\'s LGBT student group, I advise and support LeKia Pace, the organization\'s current President. I talk to Kia at least monthly to discuss the progress of the group, what she wants to work on regarding her leadership style/ability, and self-care. ','I admire the leadership (and leadership style) of my current manager, Sultan Shakir, although it is almost completely opposite of mine. Where I am great at building relationships, getting buy-in, and synthesizing information, Sultan is fantastic at collecting data, being strategic, direct and goal-oriented. \r\n\r\nI see the value in the skills that he has that I don\'t naturally possess, and have learned a lot about delegation and strategic planning from him.','Last year, Sultan told me that I try so hard to do everything that I end up not being as effective or efficient as I could be. He also warned against over-managing everything/one because of its inclination to burn young people out of the movement. He offered me suggestions on how to delegate tasks, and where the areas I could have delegated were.\r\n\r\nIt\'s truth really resonated with me. It was an honest piece of feedback that I needed to help me grow.','Job insecurity (being fired, not hired nor denied a promotion) significantly impacts LGBT (especially trans) people of color at disparate rates. Employment--and subsequently employment  security--is essential to help break the cycle of poverty LGBT POC often find themselves in as a result of discrimination against their multiplicitous identities. Because no federal and little state protections exist for LGBT people, employment discrimination is often legal','I would create an app that allowed people to find businesses within various proximities (5 mi, 10 mi, 20 mi, etc) to a person that have LGBT-inclusive polices. I would also add filters that ask if the business was owned by a person of color, was unionized, and was hiring, and their HRC Corporate Equality Index score, if applicable. It could serve to help both job seekers and patrons identify LGBT-friendly businesses.','I was unemployed between 2011-2012, and was constantly applying to jobs. I would have loved to have been able to tag my profile (like on Twitter or Tumblr) with keywords that allowed companies to update me when positions that met my skill-set appeared. For example, if I tagged my profile with the words \"administrative assistant,\" whenever a new position with those words was posted, I would get a notification.','My time is pretty evenly divided into working to improve the lives of young LGBT POC, tweeting, and baking enthusiastically.','5','5','5','5','5','2','4','5','1','5','3','1',NULL,'2','1','1','1','1','1','JeShawna','Wholley','jwholley@nbjc.org','3018286138',' friend','Vann ','Michael','vincit04@gmail.com','3018286138','friend','Monica ','Roberts','monicar62@yahoo.com','3018286138','friend',1,'I am not currently enrolled in a college/university program right now, and do not have a degree or certificate from a university.

Being a Southeast Asian woman is a unique identity as a person of color because Southeast Asians are often overlooked in the Asian American population, and we suffer from the highest poverty rates in America. Furthermore, women\'s rights are constantly being challenged, and wages are still not equal, especially in many growing industries.','I am currently working as an administrative assistant in a medical office. I have been working at this office for about a year, and in that time I have learned to exercise a great deal of patience, and have really enjoyed learning about healthcare administration in the current \"Obamacare\" climate. Though I have found my Women\'s Studies degree useful in this office, I am starting to grow out of this position and am looking forward to new challenges.','After my SEIU internship, I went through a training program to be an organizer. I hope with this training I would be able to connect to the part of social justice organizing that I am good at and enjoy doing - collecting data and distributing it as a resource for people to learn more about a cause, use it as a reference for information, and be informed when they are affected individually and as a community.','I anticipate looking for entry-level media relations and web development jobs in progressive and social justice-related organizations. I imagine that I would be qualified to apply for jobs that would entail managing web and social media spaces, as well as provide the technological support that would help the organization function more efficiently. I would like to be part of an organization that works towards addressing the needs of my communities.','I worked closely with my friend Layhannara in two campus organizations. I joined the second organization knowing nothing about its purpose or goals, only knowing her praxis: Don\'t be victimized by your identity, use it as a form of empowerment. Use your identity and background to propel you to advocate for others who may not be in the same positions. There is always something you can do to make the world better in some way, big or small.','In my everyday work life, I am mindful to advocate for patients\' access to bilingual documents, and try to patiently explain health insurance policies, especially regarding finances. I make it a point to listen and understand where they are coming from, and know that their experiences differ from my own. Outside of work, I try to share knowledge and spread awareness about issues that I am passionate about, and to engage my friends in discussion.','I would ask a former professor, Lucy Burns to be my mentor. Her perspective is so different from mine: she is a queer woman of color, and she started out in the theatre and found her social justice roots there, then moved on to become an ethnic studies professor focusing on performance and art as radical transformation. I would like to be challenged to understand artistic alternatives and find creative solutions to community issues.','I am not currently mentoring someone specifically. I am part of a women of color peer-support group - we meet a few times yearly and provide emotional and mental support to each other. We are all in different phases of our life, and the group has been a source of motivation and inspiration when we have struggled in the past. It is a unique group because we identify differently, but find so much in common in our lived experiences.','Instead of troubleshooting, my friend Trung encourages me to create solutions that are not dependent on our current heteropatriarchy and its problems (those \'isms\'), but to think outside of the system, and to think of solutions for humans. He is also the kind of guy who just does the things that you think should be done, without fear. This challenged my usual way of mulling things over and discussing every little detail before taking action.','While an intern with the labor union SEIU-ULTCW with nurses and home care workers, my team leader encouraged me to be proud of my accomplishments, my story, my family\'s history, and my identity. Every meeting started with \"our story,\" and it fostered a great working environment, and helped build our community. It was good criticism because it turned out to be a great tool in self-confidence, and in organizing, everybody has a unique story to be proud of.','In today\'s changing healthcare climate, up-to-date accurate information about healthcare providers is of utmost importance. Women\'s health rights are always changing, and women should be able to make informed decisions about their health. As new policies emerge, abortion providers are increasingly harder to find, and many crisis pregnancy centers are not abortion providers nor do they provide resources for women who want to consider all their options. ','Someone using this would find information about their abortion rights, based on their location (state). They would be able to find facilities and resources closest to them, along with facility contact information such as address and phone number, hours of operation, and services provided. It should allow them to see if the practitioners at any facility are licensed, are medical doctors, or what certificates and licenses they hold.','I struggle with this one daily - I scroll through my Facebook feed on my phone reading Lifehacker articles, or watching videos of puppies.

In addition, she faces opponents and defends her stance very effectively.','I am currently mentoring organizers in Dreamers of Virginia; several new members have joined our group from Northern Virginia Community College that want to plan events and stay updated on the progress of immigration reform.\r\nI am also mentoring Mikal Haile, a high school student who is an intern at Dreamers of Virginia and works on research for the organization (updates the scholarship database and stays updated with the state of immigration reform).','Roberto Juarez is an outstanding organizer who was a driving force behind the success of the Maryland Dream Act. I admire his enthusiasm and ability to inspire others to share their stories, in turn developing the movement\'s membership and retaining its members.\r\nOur style of leading is different because he focuses on the stories and emotional cause sharing one\'s story has while I focus on policy and goals between our movement and that of the opposition.','The best piece of constructive criticism that I\'ve received is to humanize my work; I was raised with the idea that all work must be extremely formal and as professional as possible. Although this has taught me appropriate behavior for a desk job, it does not apply all of the time to organizing. \r\nOnce this was pointed out to me, I soon learned to connect with new members, core members, and other organizers in a better level of communication.','Undocumented people across the U.S. find it difficult to find accurate, relevant information about immigration policies, nearby organizations, and the status of immigration reform.\r\nThis problems needs to be solved because people are not informed about what resources they can benefit from or even what is developing in terms of a legislature that could change their lives.','This system would allow people to access relevant information about their local immigration policy and the nationwide status of immigration reform quickly and accurately. Users would be able to find organizations focused on immigration nearby that they can contact to get help or to get involved.','I use my Gmail account to handle all of my e-mail necessities. One way in which this service could be greatly improved is by allowing users to sort contacts by company and title in addition to the standard (and static) ability to sort by name, phone number, e-mail, and address.\r\nAlthough Gmail allows \"business\" format contacts, it still lacks this essential function which would benefit users that use Gmail for business like myself.

Because of my race, class, and gender,people who I identify with most are often left out of the decision-making process, various professions, and lack the means for education to excel. However, I aim to become the change I wish to see as a community leader. ','I am currently working as a Climate Justice Fellow with a nonprofit called We Act for Environmental Justice. Currently we are initiating a campaign to increase support for the Obama\'s Climate action with an emphasis on environmental justice and addressing the disproportionate impacts of low-income communities, women, and people of color. ','Intensive training opportunities from Codes for Progress will help me with the  development of a Women\'s Resource Center and a networking website called HOPE For GREEN, which primary mission will be to increase the leadership capabilities of young women of color to compete in STEAM fields for the green economy. ','After I finish the residency program, I am going to start working for a Nonprofit in an Executive Administration position focusing on environmental issues from a civil and human rights perspective in Washington, D.C. From there, I plan to enroll at the University of D.C. David A. Clarke Law School and focus on public interest law working to expand my efforts in community development for low-income and minority communities. ','Based on my own experiences, I\'ve clearly recognized how justice must be served to correct the ills of privilege and oppression in our society. However, my commitment to NAACP has opened to me to many avenues and opportunities to increase my knowledge on finding various solutions to civil and human rights issues. I have many mentors within the organization who all instilled values of faith, integrity, and justice.','In each lesson learned, I\'ve made an effort to use that knowledge to educate and empower others in my efforts. I\'ve created my own nonprofit group called The Minority Women in Leadership Commission, Inc., worked in nonprofits that focus on civil and human rights for minorities and low-income communities, and hosted workshops and discussions to educate and empower others on social justice issues. ','If I could ask someone to mentor me, it would be Leslie Fields the Director of Environmental Justice in the Sierra Club. She is a leader in the environmental justice community that focuses on creating minority and low-income communities cleaner, safer, and healthier. I would ask her to mentor me because the same way she advocates on a national level, I would like to provide that kind of assistance on a local and state level. ','Currently, I have a mentoring group called \"The Life of DOLL\'s\" which stands dor Distinguished Outstanding Little Ladies, and also a website/ blog www.thelifeofadoll.com, in which I mentor about 7 girls on the Northeast side of Detroit at Farwell Recreational Center and provide a resource for young women of color to receive access to positive role models. ','I admire the leadership of many women; especially Harriet Tubman and Oprah. They are much different from me because of their unique experiences and their motivations. I honestly have admiration for any woman of color who uses her life to become a positive inspiration to others. However, I admire them in particular because the more they achieved, the more they aspired to reach back, educate, and empower others. The only difference is the generational gaps.','The best constructive criticism was from a friend who told me \"Stop being afraid !\"I didn\'t understand, but then he explained that my greatness lied within and I was afraid to shine because of what others may think of me. With that advice, I\'ve become determined to achieve my dreams so that I can inspire and motivate others along the way. ','There are a lack of resources and opportunities for young people to grow because of the lack access in Detroit. I believe that if young women of color had access to STEAM role models, opportunities, and resources than many economic and social barriers would be eliminated. It is important to provide a resource center or application to underrepresented communities, because the future relies on our generation to find innovation solutions to our problems.','If I could make an app for giving young women of color valuable news and upcoming information, resources, and access to opportunities then it will result in increased leadership capabilities. This will ultimately allow underrepresented communities to have access to resources that are not normally presented to them. This information would be in the form of a social network to connect with others and an interactive resource center to prosper in STEAM fields.','I use many applications to make my life complications more organized and productive. However, the tool I use most is the Chrome Book which uses a cloud to use Google applications instead of operating on a Windows interface. If I could make this tool more useful, I would make it in the form of a thin tablet with a kickstand and an invisible keyboard. Also it will have built-inT wi-fi connectors that allow access anywhere even without internet connection. ','The three things I spend most of my time on are all things that allow me to do justice, be merciful, and walk in purpose to be the change I wish to see. I spend a lot of my time volunteering for causes, working in nonprofit organizations, and creating my own projects to empower and educate young people by focusing on various social justice issues.

I\'ve learned about justice and just as much about injustice by being in the US for the past couple of years. I learned that people are able to look past bold injustices, and the way to make them acknowledge it is through story-telling. I\'ve learned that being idle is the same as not doing anything. I\'ve learned that fighting for your family\'s/people\'s rights gives you the strength to surpass enormous hurdles.  ','I became involved with Dreamers of Virginia to push for immigrant rights. I\'ve told my story numerous times now that I\'m legally in the US. I\'ve also been working towards starting a logo design company online. LogoKind offers monthly payment plans to small businesses, allowing them to pay in 12, 6 or 3 month installments instead of paying upfront (higher cost).

Very cool dude, I\'d ask him for feedback on management, and his own inspirations and mottos. ','I\'m not currently mentoring anyone. However, for about a year I was a mentor at the Apple Store for my team member. In that role I\'d inquire about their knowledge of different company goals, direct them to the right sources, and I\'d be there for them whenever they needed explanation on certain expectations, or a second opinion to broaden their thoughts. ','I admire my parent\'s leadership abilities, as I\'ve never had a child before. They\'re an inspiration because they\'re able to shape lives with their words and actions, and double as a solid pillar for three separate people. My leadership is similar but less threatening and more explanatory (Do this + The Why). If you are an example, people will follow accordingly. Both my parents style and mine are vocal, but I also enjoy painting a picture and inspiring. ','\"Don\'t take things too seriously.\"\r\n\r\nNot sure if they saw it as constructive criticism, but it brought me down to earth. It let me see the bigger picture and reminded me that there are moments when you have to take things seriously but not to a polar extreme where you began to obsess and worry about outcomes. ','Sharing names and stories of undocumented immigrations is an issue because there isn\'t a specific platform. My parents, for example, would like to help but don\'t know where to go and lose interest very quickly. Ignorance and inaction are detrimental to making change, especially when there\'s a wanting but no user friendly way to be part of it. ','It would be a social platform that allows you to make an account, share your story as your description. This platform would share information of events happening around your specific area and keep you up to date with the progress of immigration reform (or another cause). There would be polls delivered to everyone\'s accounts where your vote would count towards consensus of a specific action. \r\n','This is a program (site) for mobile, and it\'s not an app (unfortunately) but I use it about 4-6 times every day.

Since it was a priority to buy basic necessities at home I was not able to afford a computer or pay for extracurricular tech classes; instead my basic skills were learned in a once a week hour long computer high school class. ','I work as a Background Check Researcher. Corporate offices submit applications/ resumes of potential employees to us, and my duty is to verify the information the candidates provide with previous employers. Also, a criminal record search is done based on the cities where candidates have lived to report if they have a clean or criminal activities history. Overall, we are in charge of making sure the company is hiring a safe candidate as a staff member. ','This training will enable me to reach a wider range of the community. Learning how to make programs that will give me the advantage of providing information within minutes via a smart phone in a short period of time \r\nAlso, this will let me be a guide to others who want to break into this type of career. With the tools provided I will be able to volunteer as a coding tutor and help them grow as a professional.  ','I would like to work for a company interested in making positive social changes. I want to fund/ or work with a group that promotes justice for immigrants rights- although, improvement has been made to a certain point there are many other aspects that need improvement. For example, work on a project that helps young immigrants (myself included)receive an education to grow as professionals.\r\n','When I think of the word \'justice\' the first person that comes to mind is my father, Alonso Romero. His lessons were simple, yet very definig in me as a person. For example in order to be authentic he told me to always stand by what is right and fair even when others do not agree. Also, whenever given a leadership role my responsibility is to serve but to never think of myself as higher/more than others. ','While in college I worked in the Mission and Outreach Dept. Taking advantage of the position I had and my father\'s lessons. I realized that it was important to to come up with projects that could help a rural nearby town listed as one of the poorest in the US. Some of the projects were: Tutoring high school students and showing them how to enroll in college, teaching basic English to young mothers, and fundraising money for the local clinics.  ','Immaculee Ilibagiza, survivor from the Rwanda genocide in the 90\'s. I have had the honor of attending some intimate talks where we exchanged words and was truly impacted by the strength and drive to help others. She has shown me that even when things are extremely tough in life you always have to keep pushing, and fight for what you want. Now days, she dedicates herself to sharing her story, and building clinics in rural areas of Rwanda. ','Her name is Tatiana. A 14 year old teenager, has been raised in a home where she is taught that her only option once graduating high school is to get married. Although, there is nothing wrong with marriage, I have also demonstrated her it is NOT the only option. Instead, we have visited college campuses in our area, talked to her about careers she think she might be a good fit for, I do this because I want her to value the importance of education.','Mahatma Gandhi because he was a man of self-belief, persistence,truthfulness and not being afraid of taking the first step. The difference in the way we lead is that his style of was of servitude; whereas mine style of leadership is focused on being innovative because my strength is creativity. My goal is to create in order to help and I see Gandhi as the voice representing those in need.','To trust in my thoughts. I used to talk in a quiet voice in case I said something foolishly it would not be heard by everyone. This was until I met a speech professor in college. She said that although my papers had strong substance the points did not come across due to lack of confidence I presented during the speech. Since then I have taken classes to improve my presentation skills and feel more confident about sharing my ideas in a proudly manner.','My community is mainly made of first generation immigrants. We constantly face the obstacle of which organizations we should be able to trust or not. Along the years, I have met many people who have been fooled and have had money stolen from fake organization with false promises. I would like to work on something that would help validate organizations in our areas, that way it would be easier for people in the community to find aid in their specific needs.','My app would be simple but effective. In order to help people prevent them from falling into the traps of fake organizations, they will download an app in which they are able to search the kind of services they are looking for. The results will all be organizations have been verified as legitimate and registered with the town; meaning the app users will be able to trust such organizations based on the app\'s results.','Facebook and its users service. It seems now days more people are deactivating Facebook because they do not feel heard. The company needs to realize that users MUST remain feeling satisfied and safe with the changes they constantly make. For example, many people deactivate because they do not want to have to deal with complicated and always changing privacy settings. ','1.

This is currently our busy season and its fast paced and no two days are alike which I enjoy. I learn something new about people and life every day!','This training will help me organize my thoughts and give me the tools to engineer them. It will train me to build an application or website that could help people get more information about the world we live in today.','The kind of employment I will look for after this residency program would be to help my sister. She has an idea for a non-profit of helping minorities learn how to swim. She like myself was a college athlete and saw first hand how little minorities know how to swim. After this residency I would have the tools to build a website and a platform for her to start the non-profit.','I learned about justice from my parents. I learned from them that no matter how small the injustice and big the fight, you still fight for what is right. ','I try to speak up more. I try not to let the little things that I know are injustices slide. Justice to me means trying to do the right thing everyday. No matter how big or small.','My current manager is mentoring me right now. He is quiet but confident. Sometimes I may come off shy and one of the biggest things I want to learn from him is how to command attention in a confident way.  ','I played soccer in college. My senior year there was a freshman that I took under my wing. Now she is in her senior year of college. She will call me and ask me for advice about what happens after college. I’ve been helping her with her resume and looking into grad schools with her as well. The transition after college is a tricky one and can be overwhelming. I am hoping to be able to guide her now to make that transition for her in the future easier. ','I admire Steve Jobs. What I admire about his leadership style is that it was unconventional. He made it his own and demanded very high standards from anyone who worked with him. It differs from mine in that I\'m more of an introverted leader.

The client asked if we had a service which we didn\'t, and I said no. The active manager came to me and said, “I liked the way you answered the phone call, but instead of telling the customer what we can’t do tell, them what we can do, focus on that.” I think it was great because he showed me an avenue how to correct what I was doing wrong. ','A problem that affects the people in my community is a lack of information. If people knew where a local shelter was and or job center was located they could use those resources already available near them.\r\n','The app would recognize an object. For example you would hold up your phone to the object or place you want more information on. It would then read the object scan it and then the app would proceed to tell you about that object. It would be what the Shazaam app does for finding out what music is playing near you. Instead of sound recognition it would be noun recognition. The people in my community could then educate themselves on their surroundings.','Windows 8 could be improved, the interface isn’t very user friendly. Most people with only basic knowledge of how to use a computer wouldn’t be able to easily use it. I think the start screen is confusing and when I’ve used it navigate it is was unpleasant. I would do away with the start screen and put in a cleaner desktop.','My job, it has been a life changing experience working and meeting people of all walks of life. Also my family, I have two sisters and we all live in different states but we talk almost everyday! And something I also spend a lot of time on is traveling.

Having grown up in the Inland Empire, L.A. is our “big city” and its big problems, like traffic, pollution and more reach far beyond the city limits. Change for my hometown will come from precedents set in L.A.','My Communications professor, Maxwell Schnurer gave me a great foundation in social advocacy. The greatest thing he did for me was to show me the human side of my heroes of justice. These historical figures were not superhuman, nor did they act alone. He helped me understand that I don’t have to be paralyzed by the pressure to be the next Martin Luther King Jr. or Dolores Huerta. And I shouldn’t approach the fight for justice as a one-woman effort.','Since knowing Maxwell Schnurer, I have become more active in my community. After graduation, I became a teaching assistant to support, but also intellectually provoke the students whose place I was just in. I studied non-violent communication and joined the Occupy movement and helped facilitate community meetings. I also volunteered with and helped build a community chapter for Move To Amend, teaching people about Citizens United and corporate personhood.','I would ask my friend and former classmate Jacky Guerrero to mentor me because she has extensive personal experience working with the Los Angeles community and its non-profits. She grew up in L.A., so she knows the community\'s needs. And she has insider knowledge of what organizations really need to accomplish their goals.','Currently, I am mentoring my co-worker, Kim. As a former yoga instructor and active herbalist, she has a ton of ideas for blogs and articles about natural health. I use my background in journalism to help her develop a more concise writing style that’s attractive to online readers, and give her advice on search engine optimization and social media to help her articles reach a wider audience.','I admire the non-leadership style of consensus-based groups. The horizontal structure of organizations can overcome the systemic oppressions built into more traditional hierarchical organizations. As an editor, I’m used to exercising executive decisions, holding people accountable to goals and creating an overall vision within a small leadership team. While horizontal organizations can be intimidating, I have learned many valuable lessons from them.','I tend to micromanage projects because I have a specific vision for the final product. The best constructive criticism I’ve ever received was to lighten up and trust my team more. That hasn’t always worked out, but when it has the results are far better than I could have imagined. Not only does it alleviate some of the stress, but it creates a better team environment and opens up the scope of any project to include a more diverse point of view.\r\n','Drought is a serious problem for Los Angeles, and a center of commerce and production The biggest problem about living in a drought area is that most people don’t have a tangible idea of how much water their community uses, or how much they contribute to the shortage. The less people know about the problem, the less relevant it is to them. If we could show people how much water the city consumed, it could raise awareness and inspire action.','Monitoring city water usage could give people a chance to better understand the scale of community water consumption. An application that could display real-time water usage, track usage trends, and possibly even identify the biggest users could create a more informed and empowered community. A person could open the app to track the figures, and potentially even track the biggest water users (corporations) to apply political and/or economic pressure.','Buycott is a barcode scanner that allows users to avoid companies whose values they disagree with. Through joining campaigns, the app will warn you if you scan a product made by a company that conflicts with those values.\r\n\r\nOne problem I currently have with the app is that the scanner sometimes works too quickly, before you can properly frame your barcode, and overlapping user-created campaigns can overlap and detract from each others audience.','In my off time I read, volunteer with the humane society and pick my friends’ brain on sustainability projects.

There is a creativity gap in our line of work, and I hope to be part of the solution.','My passion is voter registration, and I have been fortunate to be part of a team at VPC that is constantly scouting the next big technology in VR. From SMS texting to banner ads to state online VR integration, we are pioneering new ways to expand the electorate. Unfortunately, most of the actual pioneering we outsource to vendors. After the course, I would like to return to VR—either at VPC, another nonprofit, or a 2014 campaign if my personal life aligns.','Scott was the Associate Pastor at my church growing up—a kind-hearted man in his thirties, well-liked by the congregation’s youth. One day, after years of failed relationships with women, Scott came to the realization that he was gay. He made the courageous decision to come out—in the pulpit. The sermon was titled, “I am your pastor, and I’m gay.” Some people got up and walked out of the sanctuary. Most of us, though, stayed, loving Scott for who he is.','At the time he came out, Scott was forbidden from becoming a head pastor under church rules. He eventually succeeded in lobbying the national Presbyterian body to admit ordained ministers who were not celibate or in heterosexual marriages. Injustice is everywhere, even in the most seemingly pristine places in our lives. It takes courage to fight it, and I think of Scott every time I have to speak a difficult truth or face up to bigotry. ','Mike Jensen.

To my pleasure, she received an offer, accepted, and moved to D.C. this month. ','It may sound trite, but the leader I admire most is Coach K. More than the wins or championships, I am always struck by his graciousness in both victory and defeat. His role in the fight to end cancer is largely outside the spotlight, but it prompted President Bush Sr. to attend a Duke game this week. As a West Point grad and Army captain, Coach K’s style is inherently different from mine, but I always try to emulate his intensity, humility, and empathy.','\"Being positive in a negative situation is not naive.

We send registration application forms to unregistered individuals, up to 5 million at a time.

With so many variations of our mail piece, the proofing process is long and tedious. Automating the process would improve accuracy and free up literally hundreds of hours of staff time.','First, the user directs the app to the folder containing the creatives. Then, the app proceeds to open each PDF and scan for selected edits. The app would need to have inputs for legal language or alternatively read from a CSV file where the proper language had been saved.

While unemployed, I did volunteer work for Jubilee Center of Broward, helping the homeless with computers. I also helped moderate a website for the unemployed in Florida, and I helped OpenCongress.org develop their Benefits Wiki as a volunteer.','Though I do know some HTML and CSS, I am not a programmer, and the current trend toward more sophisticated online applications has left me somewhat on the \"outside\" in terms of working on more creative web tools. I had hoped to be able to work and use my skills in some kind of political or environmental organization, large or small, that had some personal meaning for me. There are few real entry web positions in this job market, even as a volunteer.   ','Any kind of programming skills are a huge advantage in finding online jobs. Even if I ended up working temporarily on a campaign website (Zephyr Teachout is one of my heroes from the former Dean campaign), I would find that exciting and meaningful, especially with this critically important election coming up in 2014. Long term I would hope to find some kind of work for a larger organization, either political or having to do with wildlife or conservation.','My father taught me by example that you had to fight for what was right. And what was right usually meant having empathy for those who were having a hard time. I grew up in a small town in Maine, and when I went away to college in the \"big city\", one time I mentioned to him the \"bag ladies\" on the streets of downtown Chicago. My father was appalled; it was inconceivable to him that any elderly woman should have to be living on the streets in our society.','On one side of the issue of economic justice, I try to volunteer to help when I can, for example helping the homeless with computer tasks. But I know that charity alone is not enough, and I work for political causes and campaigns to whatever extent I can. The Howard Dean campaign in 2004 was the start of more direct involvement on my part, and I still consider Democracy for America as one organization that is especially aligned with my views.','I\'m assuming you mean mentoring for some aspect of coding.

I find it hard to imagine being in his shoes, since he gives the impression of sheer unwavering faith that a big venture will be successful, but I find him fascinating. With my more modest background, I tend to be pragmatic, and far more cautious. I also admire Van Jones, of Rebuild the Dream. I can relate to his constructive optimism.','I have a lot of diverse interests and know a little about a lot of things. I was once told by a work colleague that sometimes when I talk to people it can seem overwhelming to them, almost intimidating. That was a bit of a revelation that I\'m still dealing with, since I tend to assume others are as curious about things as I am. But I have taken it to heart.

I want to learn Spanish in the future, but haven\'t had the time in the evenings to do so yet. ','Currently I identify my self a young, black, gay male from the inner city of Dallas. I didn\'t understand the term \"tech\" until I was about to graduate from college. In my high the only work we did on computers was to learn how to type, if you had a decent teacher. While attending SXSW 2013 I was able to go to a few events that specifically catered to Blacks in Tech (B.I.T.)','Currently I have two amazing jobs. My full-time position is with Austin Community College where I have the privilege of serving as a Student Life Specialist in the Office of Student Life with the sole purpose of challenging the lives of students every day. Part time, I am the Co-Creative Director of a start-up non profit, The Mahogany project, which collects the stories of black gay men and turn them into performance pieces. ','With the organization I am currently trying to help start-up, The Mahogany Project, it is crucial for us to have a presence in the digital world. Not only that, but I feel like in order for me to better serve the community, I need to know how to serve my community. The passion for me to do so is there, I just need the tools to help guide me along the journey. ','After what I expect will be a transformative experience, I plan to go back to working at Austin Community College with more tools to help my students and my colleagues, while continuing to work tirelessly at getting The Mahogany Project to a self-sustaining place. If the opportunity comes along after this experience to work at a non-profit that does similar work, I would jump at the opportunity. ','Kyle Clark. Kyle was my supervisor while I was in undergrad and worked as an Orientation Advisor. The way he unpacked the systems of privilege and oppression remain with me today. Kyle taught me to look deeper than the surface levels and to dig into institutional systems that continue to discriminate and in some cases criminalize people based on differences that include but are not limited to race, class, religion, sexual orientation, and ability. ','As a student of Kyle\'s, he taught me that conversation without action is nothing. If I see something wrong, I should do something about it. So a friend of mine, who also worked with me as an Orientation Advisor, and I started The Mahogany Project. We hope this project will inspire other black gay men in Austin to use their voice to affect the change they want to see in area. ','One person that I constantly admire from a distance is Kevin Anderson, who started a project similar to mine called the T.R.U.T.H. Project. The first time I talked to him I felt a connection to his passion to improve the lives of black gay men in Houston. He continues to use his passion for advocacy to fulfill his purpose, and as someone who struggled with this, I admire it greatly. ','As a member of Delta Lambda Phi Fraternity Inc, I use my spare time to talk to a few of the members about their futures and where they want to go. Not only have I done that, but while at UT-Austin, I adopted young black gay men as my little brothers and talk to them about issues they are going through. I think it\'s also important to show my little brothers resources and opportunities they can take advantage of that will benefit them in the future. ','My current co-worker Candice Brown has a style of leadership I look on a daily basis to emulate. Candice has the ability to think about every aspect of a problem before proceeding ahead. Her confidence never wavers, even when things aren\'t going as planned. She knows exactly how to respond to any situation thrown at her with compassion, calmness, and civility. ','While working for the Office of Admissions my supervisor, Mario Villa, told me that I had the potential to be a great leader, but my attitude sometimes got in the way of that. At first, I was offended because I generally thought I was a nice person, but looking deeper into the issue, I realized I would react to situations instead of taking the time to reflect. I have worked to change my approach to any problem since that day.  ','One of the issues black gay men face in Austin is a simple one that has not been worked on, and that\'s a space to build community and congregate with other black gay men in Central Texas. I think it\'s imperative to work on this problem because this community has higher rates of suicide, depression, and HIV contraction. We need to do something to help alleviate the societal and cultural problems that are faced by black gay men. ','I would build a social app specifically for black gay men, made by black gay men that can tell someone resources within the city, events catered to this demographic, like minded individuals that are already located here, and \"safe\" spaces that are inclusive to queer people of color. ','I have an app that gives me a daily devotional, and lets me write notes about it. However, the issue is you have to go to the very beginning of the app to write a note instead of being prompted to do so. And as someone who reads different devotionals about a myriad of subjects, the notes are lumped together, which confuses me, because I forget which not is for which devotional. Having them separate would be great. ','The three main things I spend my time on outside of work are:\r\n1. The Mahogany Project\r\n2. Writing & editing my 2nd Novel\r\n3.

I was an interpreter for Spanish-speaking patients in emergency medicine (ER, ambulance, & urgent care)in the past. At this time, my only fluency is with my primary language of English.','I am considered a non-traditional student because of my age. Computers were large machines housed in square footage equivalent to a dorm room when I entered kindergarten. My expertise lies in working with people with disabilities -specifically, adults with cognitive and physical impairments.','I recently completed a long-term temporary job in rural Nevada and am awaiting admittance to graduate school. I am the parent of a 14-year old daughter, but I am not currently employed.','Because my computer knowledge and skills have all been acquired by self-teaching, I would benefit from formal training. I could use the training to succeed in a Master\'s program where human rights development and disability advocacy are a priority. Additionally, I could use the training to encourage  computer literacy programs for adults with disabilities at local centers for independent living. ','I am interested in working in the field disaster relief and recovery, specific to disabilities. It would combine my craving for crisis management and a desire for ensuring people with disabilities have equal access to independent (and safe) living.','My father is an abusive alcoholic. He taught me that living in an oppressed situation is damaging to my mental and physical health. Through his lessons, I became empowered. I share the gift of empowerment every day through a much gentler classroom.','I became an advocate... first for children who had been abused. Later, with a more in depth medical background, I was able to educate patients and their caregivers. I gravitate to adults with disabilities because they are often forgotten by families and state services, especially when they are seeking independence.','Prior to leaving the workforce and returning to college, I was a member of Soroptimist International. At that time, I was one of the younger club members and received mentoring from the wiser and more experienced women in the clubs. Currently, my mentors are my peers through the Truman Scholar Association who range in age from 21-81. Since adulthood, I have not wanted for a mentor because I am always willing to ask for help.','I mentor my daughter\'s friend. Like her mother, I had a poor role model for parenting during my teen years. I spend a great deal of time with the girls discussing all subjects -hormones, diet, exercise, homework, love, unicorns, and anything else that interests them. The best mentoring is leading by example and showing them that adults are fallible, but can succeed if they have a strong community.','I recently worked at Amazon.com for a staffing agency and worked closely with the company\'s management team. I admired their leadership qualities because they were all college-educated experts at spreadsheets and data manipulation using pivot tables which gave them an edge at calculating the intricacies of management using numbers. I have a learning disability that affects my ability to do computations, but I excel at writing reports and empathizing. ','\'Slow down.\' I have learned to spend more time assessing the details of a given situation prior to responding. This skill allowed me accurately triage patients who did not always present with life-threatening symptoms. I learned to rely on my intuition which was honed by observation and repetition.','(Example)During a wildfire evacuation, people must leave their homes without any possessions. Many take maintenance medications for health conditions- allergies, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, et. al, but do not have access to the specific details of the meds. An app or computer database is needed to ensure that people have quick access to their meds because some doses are time-specific. This could be utilized by the Red Cross or other organization.','The database would allow quick access to pharmaceutical records to ensure timely dosages of meds to people in disaster situations. Companies like Walgreens and Walmart have similar programs for existing patients, but are currently subject to state laws and have not been used in disaster situations. A patient can travel to CA from NV and quickly access a prescription if forgotten at home, as long as there is a current prescription at the same pharmacy. ','iPads and iPhones have technology that people with communication impairments use daily -such as hands free speech. This technology is not covered by any type of insurance (private, state, Medicare), but can promote independence and even the playing field at school and in the workplace. Changing Medicare coding policy can ensure coverage of all forms of adaptive technology, but the process is arduous and can take years just to receive a review by the Feds.','I enjoy spending time with friends and family via Facebook, in person, and using my iPhone.

I used to admire that part of myself, but it is an ineffective and immature way to learn new things. Knowledge is meant to be inter-communicable. Advice is a shortcut to new experiences and knowledge. Asking for help is not weak, it\'s courageous.','Politicians can accept donations from large organizations indirectly and secretively, which means politicians do not have to show who they are really accepting money from.

It is a seasonal job that follows the school schedule, so I am off during the winter and summer months. Although this job has been a great stepping stone I am ready to get back to my roots and do something more meaningful. ','It would give the organizations a voice that actually travels further than just to the few ears of whatever room the organizers happen to be in. It would allow the creation apps, actual functional websites, and the ability to build models and software that could be presented to youth and to various parts of the community that look appealing so it could get them to participate more fully. There is nothing like that now; the message would become widespread.','I would look for grass roots organizations first and foremost, preferably ones working with at risk youth. I worked in a grass roots org already, and met others in the process, and realized that they often receive grants but must pick & choose what to use it on, putting their technological needs aside to focus on the core of their mission. Employment would be ideal but if not I would like to offer services free of charge, which would get them started.','Immediately, the person who comes to mind is Samantha Wilson who is the founder of the Child Leader Project. I learned about how injustice can take many forms; ecological, social, racial, etc. She taught me that you cannot break down barriers without discussing the personal feelings involved, because everything is personal since we are human. For most people, the hardest part is opening up; through healing within ourselves, we heal our communities. ','Because everything is personal I truly believe that in order to create change we must first start in our own homes where we are most likely to sow the seeds of change. I have completely changed how I\'ve interacted with people in my home & community. Most people in affected minority communities already know the ways in which they are oppressed because they live it every day, but discussion of shared experience creates a call to action. ','I would ask my tia (aunt), Yaya. She is director of a grass roots organization here in Coachella called Culturas Music & Arts. She puts on various youth/community oriented activities meant to bring various cultures together & celebrate the beauty in diversity. She grew up seeing the marches in the fields with Cesar Chavez (who came to Coachella on multiple occasions)and she knows what it means to fight for a cause in the face of insurmountable walls. ','I am not currently mentoring anyone at the moment, although I do have mentoring experience. I use to mentor youth when I volunteered as a youth minister and again when I was with CLP. In youth ministry I was there as a peer mentor where we could openly discuss what it meant to live \"Christ like\" without having religion & the bible shoved in our faces. In CLP we mentored youth in leadership, social justice, & community service.','My current Territory Manager has a way of rallying his crew together and encourages everyone to get the job done without putting us down or speaking in a way that would cause any sort of backlash. However he does not have any sort of follow through and does not practice accountability. I try to create an atmosphere of accountability where people are free& encouraged to speak up w/o the fear of reprimand so long as it is fixed & attention is given to error.','Hands down, the best piece of criticism I ever received was when I was told I was too closed off and I came off at being \"mean\" by my facial expressions, which were often misconstrued. This was a great piece of advice because it made me more aware of myself and my thoughts, which forced me to be more present while in conversation and allowed me to be more communicative. Once this happened it seemed much easier for people to approach me & be comfortable. ','The biggest problem I have in my community is the lack of money/resources/volunteers. People where I am from do not do anything unless they are getting paid, volunteer but are uncommitted, or worse, do not find value in a cause because they do not hear it on the lips of their friends and/or colleagues. We live in a media driven world where the internet and cell phones rule all, no resources means our orgs can\'t participate in it because there is no money. ','I have dreamed of an app of communal knowledge for all nonprofits; a solitary app that can be used by each & every nonprofit in the world. One where resources, curriculum ideas, fundraising ideas, perhaps a live chat room, can all be accessed from your cell phone and uploaded by the orgs themselves. A sharing of ideas; a treasure trove. People could also type in their locations & find orgs to be a part of without scouring the internet in vain. ','Mac/Apply products are used by almost everyone I know and they are widely used in areas involving media, however, they do not offer much in terms of variety. I think that they should be more customizable, which they aren\'t at the moment. You can not switch out drives, hardware, or soup it in any way. They are a great system which can become dominant if they were to offer such simple changes','The first is my job, where I spend 8-9 months of the year working more than 40 hours a week. The other 3-4 months I work part time, because the job is seasonal. Second is with my girlfriend, who I love very much. She works in morning news & also works a second day job, so we see each other in the times left open to us. Finally, I am trying to learning programming languages on my own. I am part of Udacity and edX but completion is difficult w/o a teacher.

I\'d like to learn code in a more formal setting with other like-minded people in order to better organize and reach out to people.','I want to work in the political sector, helping either nonprofits or progressive political groups further social and economic change.','My former supervisor at The Raben Group, Ellie Collinson. She helped me understand how I was unconsciously abusing my gender privilege during a presentation at work, in which I overshadowed my (female) partner. After a short chat, my entire understanding of the concept of social privilege was expanded and I understood how people, myself especially, could overlook or ignore social privilege despite being ostensibly devoted to equality and justice.','In response to that lesson, I\'ve learned to properly evaluate my actions and thoughts, even those that I think nothing of. I no longer take for granted that my actions are not taking advantage of my privilege and instead attempt to be conscious of it and act more accordingly.','I\'d ask Teri Hart, family friend and the Division Manager of Juvenile Services with the county probation office. Her educational background is similar to mine and she took a similar path in the beginning of her career, and now works to help with the youth of the community in and out of the justice system. I\'d like to see what she feels is the best way to help the community.','I mentor a family friend. He recently found a passion for international relations and political science, and that was my major in college. I\'m giving him advice in thinking about what he wants to do and where he wants to go (both in life and for school), as well as helping him with the courses he already has. I also keep him up to date with my experiences so he can see what it\'s like down the road.','My mother is a CFO for a private high school, and she usually directs the administration. She tends to take most of the responsibilities upon herself, delegating tasks rather than those responsibilities. She\'s incredibly effective and good at what she does, but I feel my own personal leadership style involves more consensus and a more open and democratic model, one in which I take a bit more input when making leadership decisions.','I\'ve been told that I need to allow myself to be \"incomplete,\" or rather not be afraid to not have everything together all the time. It really helped because I\'ve allowed others to offer help more than before because I realize that others truly want to help and it\'s in everyone\'s best interest to work together on things.','Financial literacy. In a community with a large population of low-income families such as mine, the knowledge of basic financial concepts is hugely important to stability and prosperity of not only the individual or family but the community as a whole. Unfortunately the basic concepts of personal finance are hardly discussed in public school, leading to a population unaware of this crucial life skill.','I\'d probably design an app that is targeted toward young people (middle school through high school) that teaches the basic tenets of financial literacy. It could be \"game-ified\" (like Duolingo is to language learning) to encourage progress. Schools that are beginning to incorporate tablets into their curricula would be able to use it in classes, or there could be a web app that has similar functionality. An adult-oriented version could also be implemented.','I use Evernote to jot down notes on occasion because it\'s quicker than most other similar aps. One thing the mobile app could use is collaborative editing with friends or colleagues, maybe by linking with Facebook or a contacts list. It doesn\'t need to be as in-depth as larger word processors, but the ability to make a simple shopping or to-do list with a roommate or team from a mobile device would be fantastic.','I tend to spend a lot of time doing things with family, usually helping take care of my grandparents and helping out at my family\'s business.

','I intern at Asian Pacific Islander Obesity Prevention Alliance, a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles. I am creating a Bike to Japan program.

She got me involved in many discussions about Immigration because I need to understand Immigrant Rights in the U.S. I learned that immigrants are pushing for Immigration Reform that will possibly pave them ways to gain lawful permanent resident known as Green Card Holders to legally stay in the U.S. Also, undocumented students in California fought to have California Dream Act and it passed.','I become part of a student organization called Asian Students Promoting Immigrant Rights through Education (ASPIRE) where we discuss issues about Immigration and take action.

I get them involved in community services so they can learn about different issues that are going on in their neighborhood.

She is a phenomenal leader and author that enlighten my knowledge of dealing with issues in my daily life.

It is very difficult for me to be a leader when I have to deal with people that are against me. But she learns to love without judgment.','My mentor struck me with a constructive criticism that it changed my perspectives. He only wants to best for me so he criticized me about the type of friends I was with. Those people were not motivating or encouraging me to become the person I want to be in the future, to be an engineer. It was very impressive because he was right and I stopped doing it.

So, it is important to figure out a solution that would motivate them to exercise regularly and to avoid them overeat too much unhealthy food.  ','A perfect idea is to create an app that would show easy recipes of how to make healthier breakfast, lunch, and dinner so Asian and Pacific Islander communities can have access to it and make it a lot easier for them to feel the need to eat healthier food. They can wake up every day and look at it and it would motivate them to make it instead of always running to get fast food.

My parents are upper middle-class (though I have don\'t rely on them for financial support and am considered low-income myself).','I\'m working as a waitress, trying to waitress as few hours as possible so I can spend as time as possible organizing and working on some climate justice-related campaigns in Boston. I organize students around fossil fuel divestment and transit justice, and do communications work (media, social media, web, written materials) for the MA Governor\'s Climate Legacy campaign (climatelegacy.net). ','Our climate justice networks in Boston (youth and community) have a shortage of web designers, shoveling too much work on too few individuals and delaying campaigns. Learning to code would help me fill those gaps, and train others to help. Our networks also struggle with effective statewide communication and organizing tools, and I\'d be excited about designing tools to help solve those problems.\r\n','I may choose to work for a social/climate-justice non-profit, or I may continue my organizing work in a volunteer capacity while working as a waitress (which leaves me a bit freer to act in the most strategic way at any given time, as opposed to filling a role simply because I\'m paid to do it rather than feeling that it\'s necessary). ','Cameron was my best friend in middle school- like twins, we were both extremely energetic, enthusiastic, and at the top of our classes. The big difference between us was that his family was poor, while mine was upper middle class. In high school, he became addicted to meth, dropped out of school, and ran away from home- a very different story from mine. That taught me how much poverty and class background, not personal characteristics, shape \"success\".','The anger and deep commitment to social justice that came out of my friendship with Cameron has led me to fight very hard for a society without economic, racial, and political power inequality or injustice (with climate justice organizing as a step towards that future) . It\'s also given me perspective on my own luck in life- I don\'t complain very often, and am willing to make what other people see as personal \"sacrifices\" for social justice work.','Camilo Viveiros is a labor organizer from a nearby city who reached out to our climate group last summer when we were planning an action in his hometown. I only got to know him in a group setting, but I really admired the way he thoroughly understood group dynamics, maintained his serenity in tense situations, and fully trusted people and their intentions- even when they were doing things that could have been very offensive to him.','Akhil is a member of our fossil fuel divestment campaign who is newer to activism and organizing. I\'ve mentored him by checking in regularly with one-on-one meetings, including him in meetings I have with more experienced activists when I\'m looking for mentorship or advice, and sharing activist resources with him. ','Jacklyn Gil is a student organizer from Brandeis who is brilliant, profound, and incredibly valuable to the Boston-area community. She\'s a visionary leader who spends a lot of time reading, thinking deeply, and writing about structures of power, oppression, and the sort of social change we\'re working for, whereas I\'m more of a work-focused leader. Jackie has really guided my understanding of issues and helped make my work more strategic in the long view.','A fellow student organizer once called me out for untransparent power dynamics in our group, which I had been a part of creating. I found it extremely useful because her explanation shed light on something I hadn\'t perceived before, and she made it easy for me to get better by providing a ton of helpful suggestions for ways our group could move forward to fix the problem.','Our statewide student climate justice network regularly plans retreats to train students in activism/organizing, develop relationships across the state, and inclusively plan actions. We try to make the retreat planning process statewide through email lists, googledocs, and conference calls... but everyone hates those tools, drops off, and the work usually ends up done by the same small Boston-based friend group at the last minute.','It would be great to have one tool that stores all our documents (like reg. forms), allows for quick statewide communication (ie, a chat feature), sends email reminders to working group members about important dates, and (this is key!) shows the progress made by each working group so we can all see if we\'re on schedule. And, have it feel like a social media site with space for random fun things like cat gifs, to make it rewarding for people to check often.','Google Drive. I find its overall organization frustrating, especially as the search feature doesn\'t work very well. I would like to see a customizable home page (drive.google.com) index. Users could choose which folders (and derivative sub-folders/docs) they want visible and accessible on this index (whether owned or shared by the user- that\'s irrelevant). Users would have a separate space for all the folders/docs that they don\'t regularly need.','Climate justice organizing, especially with youth, is the most central part of my life. I love the excitement of strategy and action, the community, and the hope for the future we\'re creating.\r\nI also enjoy running/working out- it\'s satisfying to set a plan, work towards goals, and see progress. \r\nLess frequently (when I manage to be calm), I appreciate connecting with beauty and spirituality through poetry and art- it\'s both uplifting and grounding.

I was laid off from my previous job in the same industry in 2012. As a result, I am looking to change careers and move into the tech field. Both lay-offs were a result of each company\'s financial difficulties and not my job performance.','My career thus far can best be described as lobbying. I have represented people who already have the means to buy into the system. Not only have I faced setbacks professionally, but my heart has not been in it. I want to make a difference by helping those who face social inequities, particularly in healthcare. I believe this program will give me the skills and connections to begin doing so, while also working toward improving my community and country.','After I finish the residency for this program, I will be looking for a coding/tech position within a progressive organization that works for positive change. I plan on combining my background in political advocacy, with my personal progressive beliefs and the skills I learn in this program to make a difference within my community and country. Ideally, I will be providing tech support within the healthcare/public health realm.','One of my closest friends suffers from hemophilia. Through my relationship with him, I have learned about the challenges faced by those who are afflicted with rare medical conditions; including barriers to health coverage and care, and a lack of understanding from others. This is a severe social inequity that, while partially addressed within the Affordable Care Act, is still faced by those who require rare and expensive medical treatment. ','I have taken this knowledge from my friend and have attempted to educate others where possible (face-to-face discussions, social media, etc.). Unfortunately, I do not feel as if I have done enough to fix the injustice, nor do I know exactly how to start doing more. This is what I want to work toward in my career; and I hope to use this program to start. ','My ideal mentor is a woman who I have known for the past two years who works in health advocacy. A former professor of mine thought we would make a good pairing and connected the two of us. She is an expert in her field and has amazing contacts within the healthcare arena. I want to work toward a world where health care is an inclusive concept, and I believe she has the knowledge and tools to help guide me in accomplishing that. ','I am not currently mentoring anyone officially. However, I occasionally assist a friend of mine with her Girl Scout troop when they work to meet certain badge requirements. For example, I recently taught a dance class for the girls so they could earn a Dance Badge. In the future, I would love the opportunity to giveback and serve as a mentor because I firmly believe that mentors provide invaluable guidance and assistance.','I admire the leadership of my former supervisor. He is one of those rare managers whose own hard work and dedication is infectious, and makes his employees want to be better. He is a natural leader, whereas I am not. I\'m an introvert, which can make it difficult to lead at times. As a result, I try to lead by example rather than directly; but continue to strive to become comfortable in a position of leadership. ','The best piece of constructive criticism I received was when someone told me to \"stop being such a wimp.\" I\'m a perfectionist and a thinker, which makes me overly cautious and can hold me back. Since that critique was made, I have tried to start taking calculated risks in life. This program, in many ways, is one of those risks. It would be a brand new career and way of life. It\'s frightening and risky; but it\'s time for me to \"stop being such a wimp.\"','In this country, healthcare has become a commodity for the wealthy when it should be a right for everyone. This has resulted in profit-hungry insurance companies, increased healthcare costs, and declining health for those who do not have access to health insurance and services. While the Affordable Care Act has taken steps in the right direction, there is still much that must be done to better health education and care.','It is no secret that the online exchanges have not performed up to standards. In addition, individuals without regular access to a computer (rural, low-income, etc.) face barriers to utilizing those exchanges and the services they provide. Many of these same people, however, still have access to smart phones. Developing an app that links to the exchanges would help to provide greater access for those individuals.','Due to my employment status, I currently use Washington, DC\'s Unemployment Insurance Service Center. This website, however, is only designed to work properly when using Internet Explorer. For many people, IE is not their browser of choice, nor do they have direct access to it; particularly if they own a Mac. The website should be updated to support others browsers so a greater number of people can easily access the social support they need.','1) Thinking about my career - I have been laid-off twice in my current field. I continue looking for new jobs, but also brainstorm ways to make a bigger difference in the world.\r\n2) Being active - I love to be in constant motion. I spend a lot of time going to dance classes, working out at the gym, or walking the streets of my neighborhood.\r\n3) Music - I have been a musician my whole life.

My mom\'s demonstration of respect for Tessie was my first and deepest example of justice for all people.','When I was in grad school studying environmental science, I noticed that we never talked about people and communities that are affected by environmental changes.

Rather, I regularly schedule development chats with (younger) peers to explore a multitude of topics. We cover topics from career development, salary negotiation, grad school application, to personal growth and reflection, and romantic relationships. My propensity to dive deep in these topics allows the other to reflect/gain awareness and make decisions best suited for them.','The first person who comes to mind is Michelle Rhee. She is unafraid of others\' opinions as she forges forward in spite of the historically difficult barriers of the public school system. Her boldness is inspiring and different.

His advice reminded me to always remain authentic.','Student loan debt reached $1 trillion in the US in 2013. Borrowing students have little information about their loans, how much they\'re committed to in total, and how the loans will impact them post-college. As a result, many borrowers today are feeling the impacts of unexpected debt burdens never experienced in previous generations. If no action is taken, future borrowers would continue to spiral into more debt, detrimentally shifting social dynamics.','My site - ourdebtstory.is - will allow current student debt borrowers to share their debt stories without shame or taboo.

My parents spoke in native tongue [Tongan] but my elementary, middle, and high school teachers spoke English. I spent two summers teaching and living in Tonga, where daily dialogue was Tongan; difficult yet rewarding. Additionally, I\'ve taken six years academic Spanish, and with repetitive review can I claim tri-linguistic.','In blunt, Tonga. My name is my story. Teaching in a Tongan academic setting in a  culturally enforced environment has  opened my eyes to the state of the art privilege, made available in America. Growing up in East Palo Alto, Ca yet schooled in white suburbia, I experienced a duality of oppression and opportunity. Studying race and social justice at the University of Redlands, the reality I live in has become my canvas. ','No.','The aggregated data received by the U.S Census Bureau conveys disproportionate information for the NHPI community, as we tend to be counted as Asian Americans.   Statistics pertaining to unemployment, poverty and academia should only describe NHPI population. This gathered data will help better define issues and long term solutions as well as community growth and strengthening. Vague, yet vital to preserving culture in diaspora communities.  ','After the internship, I plan to return to finish the last semester of my undergrad. However, after completing my undergrad, my mission is to return to the Kingdom of Tonga to lead a movement of educational reform as well as putting into practice different methods evolving around a theory of modernizing the Tongan culture and her people, without westernizing. Using education as a vehicle, my agenda is clear; modernize without westernizing. ','As mentioned before, Alisi Tulua opened a door for me to learn more about my culture and ancestry but also how to integrate that knowledge into modernity and in my work. Tulua highlighted patterns and similarities across all cultures of the South Pacific. Though these events occurred at different time periods among different people, the Samoan Mau Resistance Movement and the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian dynasty are two major events that impact us all.','Gratitude. Before attending PILOT, I thought I knew who I was, my identity in American society. Growing up in white suburbia, my parents stripped me of my culture. It wasn\'t until college where I began to ask questions of who I was, in which PILOT provided. I am a Tongan Pacific Islander woman; a fearless warrior; a kindhearted soul. This might not mean a lot to you [reader] but to know thy self is key to my journey, a stepping stone to the milestone. ','Hon. Dr.  \'Ana Maui Taufe\'ulungaki is the director of Tonga\'s Ministry of Education as well as the director for the Tonga Women\'s Crisis Centre. Her story is very similar to mine. After winning a grant to return to Tonga, it has become her mission to work with the Tongan youth to provide better services and teaching curricula. Her vision and commitment to help her people are reflective of her hard work and distinguished position as a feminist. ','I am the President of the African American Association on campus. I lead meetings most of the time, and sometimes I proctor these sessions. It is my responsibility to create a safe space for the small percentage of Black students on campus. I develop ideas, as well as help others formulate events, programs that are on campus. I am a leader, and a follower when needed. ','My longtime friend and roommate, Vijay Sachdev, is the coordinator of REACH, a program where students go into juvenile halls and tutor/mentor young inmates. His superb ability to articulate his ideas into speech makes me admire his leadership. That mixed with his tendency to be blunt and direct makes him unique. What makes us different is our styles of creativity, in which I love to take risks and push the limit. ','After giving a business presentation to a client, my professor pulled me to the side to congratulate me as well as challenge my way of being. She told me of the potential she saw, but what I was missing was being proactive. It was a huge hit to my ego, yet it helped me refine certain aspects of my life, and cutting out completely other parts. Since then, I have been more proactive in everything I commit to. ','Modernize without westernizing. This is a huge problem not only in the Tongan community in the islands but also in the diaspora communities in the U.S. The NHPI community must understand where they come from in order to know where they\'re headed. To honor our past by investing in our future. When a culture dies, so does the authenticity of its people. ','Introducing culture mapping using GIS (Geographic Information Systems). GIS will allow Tongan students to input real world phenomena pertaining to the culture, land, food, history of Tonga and make it accessible worldwide, thus creating a bridge between the indigenous and diaspora communities. With GIS, we can create several layers of information on what single map; thematic cartography. ','I\'m not a fan of the explicit information my computer has memorized about me. If I could improve one thing, I would manage database settings where computers only remembers a certain amount of information for only a set period of time (e.g 20 seconds) than it deletes itself from the computer memory. That is an improvement. Not all things need to be quickly inputted with just an enter button. ','I put God first in my life, without complaint or question. Also, hanging with friends and family (which is very very important), and writing. Writing is a huge component of my life. Whether it be through a blog, novel writing, scripting or just freestyle poetry, writing is an escape.

I support the technology team by preparing IT-related software and hardware documentation for third party certification and accreditation processes.  \r\n','If I can’t create useful tools or products for the public, I won’t be an effective public servant.

','A friend who survived years of horrific abuse was rebuffed by her parents and authority figures when she tried to get help. Her disclosure made me realize how entrenched victim blaming is in society, and that many survivors don’t have anyone to talk to about their trauma. I\'ve come to feel that when traditional authority figured fail to intervene, civil society must.','I read a lot of books and articles on how to support survivors of trauma, educated myself on topics like rape culture and slut-shaming, and began working for an organization that helps survivors. On a day-to-day, If I hear oppressive language, I try to engage the speaker and talk about why they think that way, and get them to rethink their assumptions.','Ellen Miller of the Sunlight Foundation really impresses me, because she has overseen the development of some brilliant tools, such as OpenCongress. However, I would love to talk to any of the developers at the Sunlight Foundation.','I have an older brother with learning disabilities and very close friend with severe epilepsy. Both of them have found it difficult to find consistent employment and go to school full-time. I help them research special hiring authorities (e.g. Schedule A), scholarship opportunities, and online programs for part-time students. Most of all, I try to be a sounding board for their ideas and offer support for when they’re feeling discouraged.','Despite my antipathy for many of her policies, I have some admiration Margaret Thatcher. She led with conviction and seemed to love being a public figure.  In contrast, I’m more of a consensus-seeker, and prefer a more private life. However, I think a little dose of boldness does one good from time to time.','A former colleague in an environmental organization I led told me that I needed to be less hesitant to ask our members to do things on our group’s behalf.  I realized that not asking for help absolved them of any responsibility, and thus, connection to the group. After that talk, I asked more members for help, and built far more productive (and trusting!) working relationships. ','In the United States, it is estimated that 400,000 rape kits remain untested. Evidence from these kits can identify an unknown attacker and implicate the presence of a known suspect. Most importantly, testing shows survivors that their cases are a priority for law enforcement. However, very few state or local governments and zero federal agencies track this rape kit data, making it more difficult to determine which states and cities have backlog. ','Broadly speaking, I want to build a free organizational tool for local activists to help investigate whether public officials are withholding information on untested rape kits. The tool would serve as a project management platform (like ZoHo or Jira) and repository for best practices and protocols. Ideally, the platform could be used by multiple activist groups, who could then choose to communicate with one another to share strategies and findings. \r\n','Songsterr is an application that shows and plays guitar parts for individual instruments in songs. In its present state, it supports  ½ speed playback, meaning a song can be played 50% slower. This allows users to practice at a slower pace, and thus, work their way up to a faster tempo. However, providing more playback speeds (e.g. 10%, 30%, 75%)  would allow its users to progressively work at their own pace and gain further mastery.','Outside of work, maintaining relationships with my friends and family takes up the bulk of my time.

Coming from an immigrant and low-income background, I have often struggled with reconciling my passion for social justice along with my responsibility to my family. For me, Code for Progress presents a fascinating opportunity to bring my interests in the technology and my progressive values together.','I am not currently working but I am enrolled in one evening class.','I believe this training would allow me to get a job in the tech industry. Hopefully, within the tech industry I would use my new found job and skills to help the low-income immigrant community in new ways. ','After completing the residency for this program, I would seek a career in technology within the social progressive movement. I hope to be involved in assisting others from my community who do not have important resources like a fast computer or even internet access.  ','My oldest sister was the first person to have taught me about justice. She taught me to recognize inequality and injustices everywhere and to not do anything is as bad as participating in those injustices. ','The most important thing that I have done in regards to what I have learned is to change what I wanted to do with my life. I have stared to pursue all areas of computer science in an attempt to help repay the sacrifices my parents made. I realized the inequality between my low-income immigrant community and the upper-class, advantaged ones and have decided to follow a path in computer science and this Code for Progress opportunity. ','From my own community, I would ask my brother-in-law Gabriel Ramirez to mentor me. He is someone who would be able to guide me with his knowledge and experience of the technology industry. ','To be honest, I have not had the opportunity to mentor anyone. My family and I have been moving quite a lot these past couple of years and this instability has not allowed me to settle in and become involved in mentoring someone. Although, I would love to have the opportunity to mentor someone if I were to be accepted for this program.   ','A leader I have always admired was former Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. His passion and refusal to give up to help his country were my favorite attributes of his. I also believe there were legitimate criticisms of who he was and his style of leadership. I feel as though my own brand of leadership involves more consideration of people\'s criticisms of me. ','The best piece of constructive criticism that I have gotten was from my mother who always tells me if I were thirsty, the well will not come to me, I need to go to the well. The reason I cherish this advice is because it taught me a lot about the life of immigrants and low-income families. Wanting to become something would require a lot of hard work and it would never come easily to us. It helped me embrace hard work and adversity that would come in life. ','One of the challenges for  low-income immigrants is getting information and connecting with organizations who create social change. There are too many examples where immigrants want to take action against inequality but do not know how or are stopped in their efforts to do so, an example are exploited workers. This is a two way street - it is just as important for organizations to connect with immigrants because we are a growing, powerful base. ','I would make an app that would allow immigrants to easily access a variety of organizations that they may be unaware of. Immigrants face many unique issues such as barriers to voting and discrimination in the work place. Having an app to allow them to connect with organizations like FairVote, Jobs with Justice or the National Immigrant Project would help them be informed, become a member and take action. This app would serve as a social justice directory.','I use a website called Codeacademy which allows me to learn and practice some coding. I was disappointed that they do not have an app for android phones but do have one for iPhones. I would improve the Codeacademy app by making it available on android phones. In addition, in a 2013 Pew study, more low-income communities were more likely to have android phones as well, which is more troubling because this shows the tech industry also has inequality. ','As I mentioned before, I spend a lot of time on Codeacademy to help practice coding since any career would be heavily skills based. I also spend time on my education. Currently, I am on break but I am an avid student who seeks to get his Bachelor\'s in Computer Science in the future. Lastly, I spend a lot of time with my family, who always support me and push me to be better.

','Not to pigeonhole myself, but my marginality comes out of my being a Latina lesbian.  I know specifically that women and Latino (really, most people of Color) are kept from coding literacy, both because of educational access and societal norms.  While there are arguably more queer coders, most are male and White. ','Until very recently, I was working two part-time jobs while I finished grad school.  I was pretty fortunate in that both jobs were affiliated with the university.  One was as a research assistant for a campus professor, and the other was as a Student Coordinator for a Tufts program geared toward helping first-generation students transition to college. ','Long-term, a friend and I are hoping to start a project to bolster coding literacy in our hometown of Los Angeles. LAUSD recently purchased millions of dollars of iPads, and yet overwhelmingly students aren\'t being taught coding skills they need to develop their own apps, or shape their own learning. Long-term, I hope to pass on this training by developing culturally-specific educational tools, and helping students design their own coding projects.','Ideally, I\'d love to work for a LA-based organization focused on (or at least aware of) dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline by supporting youth learning and leadership development. ','My mom has always taught me (through example and expectation) three things about justice: 1) life is not about being perfect, it\'s about being useful; 2) \"teaching\" is just as much about listening and learning; and 3) my personal struggle and survival is linked to the struggle and survival of my community. ','My schooling was spent intensely studying the nuanced ways U.S. society empowers White, male, straight citizens at the expense of my communities. This study forced me to take a step back from jumping to action to consider the ways I might be creating problems in my attempts to solve them. I try to \"act\" through learning and support; I\'ve been a Student Coordinator, a TA, a SAT/writing coach, a summer school reading assistant, and drugs workshop leader.','Alex Davila was in one of my classes; she founded and manages a community organization called Sociedad Latina serving Mission Hill in Boston. I think a lot of times I\'m shy to \"act\" on my political beliefs, and she took her experiences and turned them into the kind of community service I think produces real, sustainable change. I\'d hope someone like Alex could help me overcome my hesitancies and help me be more executive, while still being cognizant. ','Evelyn is one of 23 incoming Tufts first-gen freshman that I work with as a Student Coordinator for BLAST. We get coffee and lunch regularly - half of what I try to do is be an academic resource, half is trying to help her articulate her goals for her college career and life, and provide support and encouragement in achieving them. As part of that support, we had many frank conversations about our experiences with class, race, gender, and sexuality.','In college, I had a friend named Tabias who led efforts to create an Africana Studies department on the Tufts campus.  I really admire the way he puts his name and his body on the line: he gives speeches, he runs rallies and sit-ins, and he tells people exactly what he believes. I think we fundamentally differ in that he makes statements where I ask questions, but I\'d like to adopt more of the strength of conviction that he embodies. ','I met with a community college professor in L.A. when I was thinking about pursuing academia, and I told him that I was kind of shy. He said that it was time to give up on that idea about myself. He told me about his own crippling shyness, but that he checks that part of himself at the door because his teaching was too important. I\'d gotten so used to the idea of myself as a shy person that I was excusing myself from doing critical work I believe in.','It\'s no secret that major cities like Los Angeles and New York have a long history of police abuse against people of Color, and yet there aren\'t many institutions in place to keep police accountable for their actions. Not only is the high level of police presence in communities of Color often violent (and frankly, illegal), but it\'s contributing to unprecedented levels of mass incarceration for Black and Brown men and women. ','I think we could create some community accountability for policing practices by developing streamlined, online, and public of reporting and publicizing instances of wrongful force or harassment. People could even use smartphones to photograph or record instances of abuse that could then be documented immediately (often, officers force people to erase recordings). This could also give people appropriate voting information for police leadership elections. ','I love Tumblr. I think it\'s a fantastic, community-oriented, collaborative online space, and I even think that some of its design flaws are actually what make engagement on Tumblr so unique and thoughtful. I wonder if some of that online community could be translated into offline community by allowing users to search and find other Tumblr blogs run in their neighborhoods with a geographic search feature. ','Lately, the majority of my time is spent finishing my M.A. thesis, which looks at the way the term \"militant\" is used as a way to police people into \"appropriate\" ways to fight for racial justice. Meeting with students in my job as a Student Coordinator takes another chunk of time. Outside of school, I volunteer for a local org called Black and Pink; mostly I help them design and format some of their educational resources and zines.','5','5','5','4','5','2','5','5','2','3','4','2',NULL,'3','3','2','3','1','1','Sabina ','Vaught','sabina.vaught@tufts.edu','(617) 627-3244','Academic advisor; program director','Robert','Mack','robert.mack@tufts.edu','(617) 627-2000','Boss, Bridge to Liberal Arts Success at Tufts (BLAST) Program Director','Nicholas','Franks','franksnj0624@gmail.com','(310) 963-4657','Friend; we\'ve been collaborating in trying to start a technology literacy program in L.A.',1,'I\'m in the last stages of finishing a M.A. in Educational Studies.

','My family uses an EBT card to help pay for groceries. Just because a family is struggling, doesn’t mean that they don’t have a credit card (in fact, they probably have more than one). It would be a great idea to integrate the credit card and the EBT Card. There would be one less card to carry, and families could avoid the unfortunate stigma of carrying around a card. The EBT card should also be easily monitored from an online statement.','First, I spend the bulk of my day interning.

This training will better equip me with tools necessary to complete numerous projects. In particular, I am working on designing an Arduino based \"smart\" aquaponics garden that essentially takes care of itself with little maintenance. Incorporating code from programs such as Python may prove to be beneficial when I reach the step of interfacing the system with an Android smartphone.

He pointed to number \'1\' on a piece of paper taped to his wall which was a list of all PhD\'s received a certain year, broken down by demographics and field of study.

Clarissa has traveled all over the world and has had the opportunity to meet people from different cultures. She has learned so much through her various life experiences and it is emulated in her everyday interactions with others. I admire her accomplishments and the manner in which she has dealt with adversities and overcome obstacles and I learn a great deal simply from interacting w her.','Unofficially, I mentor several young girls at my job with TGIF. They look up to me because I am older and I have a college degree. As a result, I seem to be the go to person for practical life advice. I mentor them by providing objective feedback and helping them work through any issues they are having.','My friend Clarissa Bruce leads by example. She is patient, respectful, and nonjudgmental.

I also speak beginning Spanish. ','I would indeed include myself in the \"excluded\" community that the program references. I  am an African American male with roots in a lower income community. It is of my personal belief that technology is definitely the key to advancement for the future. ','I just recently completed a post graduate fellowship with Carnegie Mellon. The program\'s study was an Urban Design intensive program focused in design where we learned urban design concepts and strategies investigated the implementation of sustainable design, and green infrastructure for the execution of urban design solutions for blighted communities. It was a great opportunity where I was able to give back to a community which was historically excluded  ','I believe that this training will definitely be an additional asset to add to my design education. By enrolling in this programming and learning to code I can take the information that I learned and spearhead initiatives in neighborhoods like the one I grew up in or where my fellowship was concentrated and introduce supplementary educational programs based in technology in design to a group of people often absent from these areas.   ','Upon the completion of the residency I plan on creating an opportunity for myself where I am able build on my strong design background and develop programming and apps to introduce design and technology concepts to a context of people who are often traditionally absent from the technology movement. With this I hope to increase the presence of minorities in design engineering and technology advanced degree and or trade fields.','I believe that I definitely learned about the concepts of justice and reciprocity from my parents. To me the model of justice extends beyond the model of action to counter a negative action but putting out positive energy to have positive energy returned. The specifics of that is treating people kindly, the development of a strong ethic makeup, and the importance of civil rights and social justice.  ','My focus both in college through my research and community service, as well as jobs I have taken outside of college have been community-centric. My fellowship research was concentrated in implementing sustainable infrastructure in the blighted neighborhood of Larimer in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. This lends itself to producing positive actions to help promote positive change.','I would ask my friend Amanda Spann. Amanda was recently named Business Insider\'s 30 Most Important Women in Tech for her efforts to increase the number of African American in tech, especially women. I feel like her work and the strides she has made in technology would be an excellent model to follow.','Someone that I am currently mentoring would be a young man by the name of Kayin Shabazz. He is in middle school and I help him with homework as well as early college preparation. Apart of my mentorship is also related to spending quality time with him to work as a positive African American male role model for him. ','A person\'s whose leadership I admire would be the president on whose e-board  in which I acted in the capacity of the vice president. I admire that she was willing to make decisions in which she was willing to lose the support of others for a common good. My leadership style adheres more to a how can we first develop a compromise to reach a desired effect. Each of our styles works towards a common good. ','An excellent piece of constructive criticism that I have received is about being satisfied when I put my best effort forward. I often internalize what I could have done better. Once I stopped doing that I was better able to build from experiences to increase how productive I was in my next venture. ','I think one of the major problems that affects people in my community is the technology gap. One of the things that makes it harder for people to overcome this gap is education. The education system, especially as it pertains to technology is one of access. I believe that a way that I can help mitigate this gap is by creating an app or a computer program in game form that teaches the concepts of technology, i.e programming, as well as design.  ','If I could create an app or computer program it would let people a play a game with daily or weekly objectives that taught concepts of technology. They can then compare scores they receive and post them on social media, or even internet job boards which create resumes of their skills highlight their qualifications for a job or desired position. Everyone would be able to use it.  ','An app that I use is Linkedin. Like what I mentioned in the previous response there should be a component that allows members of the outlet to improve or gain the skills that employers are looking for, that they might be lacking. I suggested that there be weekly or daily objectives that they can complete which are posted thus developing  resume for that member that can be viewed by those employers.

It was a class we took once every two weeks where we mainly just typed our written papers, without having learned how to properly type first. I took a computer course in high school where I was taught to type and use the basics of Microsoft Office. Most of what I know now, I learned out of curiosity over the years and I desire to expand my knowledge on computers with this great opportunity.','I am currently employed at Amazon.com LLC in Phoenix, Arizona, as a warehouse associate. I\'ve been working there since I received my work permit through Differed Action in July.','I believe this is a great step I can take, not only for myself, but for the people around me who struggle when it comes tech-related issues.

','The main person I can think of is my former teacher from Peer Leadership, a course I was selected into in high school. Our main project in his class was to help mentor Freshmen who were failing classes. He taught me and many others the importance of communicating well and the proper way of listening.','It became a habit to properly listen to someone and use the methods he taught me to better understand and respond. After taking his class, I continued to mentor troubled students. Many of these students still remember me and have built on to the skills that I passed on to them. ','Joel, my brother, has been and still is one of my biggest mentors. Unfortunately, he no longer lives with me and my family due to the injustices we live with. He is the person I would like to ask to mentor me, especially in computers and leadership. He self-taught himself by experimenting with the hardware and software of computers and also learned some coding on the way. He is a strong leader now as a supervisor for Teletech. ','Currently with school and work, I have very little free time. When I do get a chance, I like talking to my younger cousins and learn about their troubles. I try to give them advice to help them out. I also have many talks with my nephew, who comes to me with questions.','I know a particular person who likes to lead aggressively. She is a Team Leader in a fast food restaurant where she is in charge of up to 5 people. She is always on the go getting things done whether she is at school, home or work. As for me, I like to take things passively. I am a very patient person. I like to keep control and order. Sometimes I think I should be more aggressive like her when I have to take charge. ','My father always told me \"never hesitate.\" He believes that thinking twice, when an immediate response is necessary, causes mistakes. I have kept this in my head ever since he first told me in a soccer game and now everything I do I always try not to hesitate. This has worked well with me at work and other situations where I must take immediate action. I find myself not doing certain things at all just because I hesitated in the beginning. ','One of the biggest barriers I see people hitting in my community is immigration related. Many people are largely affected by injustice laws and discrimination daily. It\'s hard to cope with this at times. Many people are uncomfortable with it, but have no other choice. I think the main reason this problem still exists is because many people are uneducated with what is going on and how others are affected. Passing on the information can be the best solution.','I like to stay up to date with the most trending things online. I see that a lot of people are into games on their devices. I have an idea of creating a game that will illustrate this issue but in an unconscious way. Giving them the link to the problem, but not the problem itself. For example sending the message of injustice through something they enjoy. Inflicting emotions on the players. Making them work harder for less and taking away on top of all that','I think security is something everyone is concerned about. I like to keep my personal information away as much as possible from the network. I know that if someone with the right skills wanted to steal it, they would be able to even if they lived on the other side of the world. Better security systems is something I would like to focus on because now it\'s a necessity and it will continue to be. ','At this time, I spend most of my time at work, school, and sports. I work full time at a warehouse, where I do a lot of labor work. I just started school again and I do like to spend time there, especially since now I am learning about computers which is my passion.

I also work with my old high school, and middle school district talking to students a couple times a month, and showing them that anything is possible. And they don\'t have to be products of their environments.','There is a girl in my organization named Maria Castro. She is the definition of Servant Leadership; a term created by Ken Blanchard. She leads by example, she is not looking for fame, or a reward, she will be first in line before asking anybody to follow.  I have learned a lot from her; I sometimes complain about people not taking initiative, when I realize I am people.','I had to work extra hard to prove my worth through out high school both in track and field and academics. Whether it was about who is the fastest man in the state or who has the best grades, I would beat you at both. Till my friend made me realize I was putting down people instead of helping them up. I was enthralled by overachieving, I did not realize I was hurting my peers. After that I learned to share my knowledge to give other those opportunities.','There is random immigration raids done by Joe Arpaio in my community. Although we were able to put monitors on his actions, it would be nice to have an app that would instruct undocumented people on their rights and regular procedures in different situations with the \"law\".

Detroit, mostly minority and historically known for its automobile and industrial roots is just now catching up with other major metropolitan areas that have been ahead of the curve in the tech industry. There was a natural inclination for most Detroiters to downplay the impact of the tech industry because of the automobile and manufacturing industries. Because of this, our citizens and workforce have suffered. ','Yes. I work as an IT Manager for a non-profit substance abuse treatment center/shelter. I\'ve been there for three years but only 2 years in an IT capacity. I primarily service the staff and ensure that they can access system/network resources regularly but I also mentor youth and alumni of the program who show interest in information technology. I also function as the social media manager and webmaster, redesigning and administering their Drupal site. ','I spend most of my free time reading \'how-to\' books on programming and attending community empowerment/art functions in my area. I would like to bridge that gap with formal instruction and hands on experience from those who are experienced in the so-just professional environment & technology. This training will serve as a sort of guide for me to continue build on the two things I love, which are helping to empower people and working with technology.','Primarily, I\'d like a position that allows me to help people. I also desire a position that allows me to be creative in solving problems. I am open to grass roots, art communities, public initiative campaigns, youth organizations, health and wellness organizations, i.e Yoga, etc (I\'ve done social media for a non-profit Yoga organization that serves under-served populations) and others alike. I\'m open to the possibilities!','It\'s ironic that I\'m submitting this on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. There is so much that icon has taught me and the world about justice that it is impossible to name even a few in this text field. Dr. King taught me about the significance of human worth. To me, that is what justice is all about. It is about realizing and understanding that everyone is worthy of equality, happiness, and a fair chance. Also, Plato\'s \"The Republic\" taught me much.','From a humanistic perspective, I remind myself and behave with one simple notion: Do onto others as you would like done onto you. Empathy is what allows me to stay humble and realize the ideals of what social justice embodies. I\'ve also had to study and learn from those that have come before me so that I can work effectively in the present. ','I would love to be mentored by Cory Booker, former Mayor of Newark, NJ. Although we come from completely different beginnings, he is someone of stature and experience that I think is in tune with the the plights of under served populations. I believe he has a genuine desire to do good and I think there is a lot that I can learn from him in terms of personal and professional development.','I mentor a 23 year old male that is a part of my current employer\'s Residential Youth Prevention program. He actually showed an interest in me during his treatment. Over time he became an official intern of mine. Many days we simply talk. We talk about his educational/career goals, family, and his feeling about being dis-empowered being in our shelter. I try to guide & develop such conversation that allows him to think critically & arrive at solutions.','I admire Steve Jobs a lot but he was pretty mean sometimes from what I\'ve read and seen depicted in film. I like how he was always thinking outside the box and pushing the limits on creativity but he needed a lot of work on his people skills, lol. I\'m more of a humanist in that I care about peoples feelings, sometimes to a fault. Jobs was able to push past that. I may have trouble hurting feelings to get the task done.','I was told that I should stop trying to do too much. They told me to learn how to say no. This is related to the answer to question 7 a bit. I want people to be satisfied. Not necessarily with me as a person but with the job I\'m there to do. However, trying to do too much began to cause problems for me in that tasks were forgotten. Saying no (or creatively helping them help themselves without leaving my desk) and prioritizing tasks helped me tremendously.','The problem is people lack a sense of true community in Detroit. People need resources to find things like affordable housing and jobs but don\'t travel outside their immediate network of friends and family too much to find them. I don\'t want people in my community to be afraid of each other. I want them to help each other. We can\'t grow or build if we don\'t help each other, and we can\'t help each other if we\'re afraid of one another.','I\'d make a local social networking app built based on location. It\'s focus would be live, work, play. It would be some sort of feed of available jobs, housing, and local activities/events that you could browse and suggest to others in your network or area that are looking for something. For instance, if your friend is looking for a chef job and you see it on your feed, you can send it to them with the click of a button.','I would make software simpler. I\'m not sure if this is what the question was asking for but I see overly complex software all of the time and I just wonder to myself, is all of this necessary? I\'m a proponent of the idea that if a piece of software has so many features and functions that it\'s almost impossible to learn all of them fluently, then you don\'t really need most of those functions.','I spend most of my time studying, working at my job and other organizations in the community, and experimenting with art and technology. I\'m always reading, whether its a cool blog, technical book, or fiction. My iPad is never too far away. I spend a significant amount of time working at my job Mariners Inn. I also spend a lot of time going to art galleries, plays, drawing, painting, or something of the sort that involves being creative.','5','5','5','5','5','5','5','5','4','5','4','1',NULL,'3','3','1','1','1','1','Cheryl','Newton','cnewt6@sbcglobal.net','313-506-7632','Cheryl is my former supervisor.','Janel ','Yamashiro','the.internet.is.ok@gmail.com','313-244-3116','Janel is my mentor and web instructor from Allied Media Project\'s Detroit Future Media program.','Shauna','Vercher-Morrow','sverchermorrow@gmail.com','313-682-2376','Shauna is my former co-worker.',1,'I previously attended Michigan State University and Devry but did not receive a degree.

By expanding my toolbox, with the element of code writing, it would leave my canvass limitless.','Currently I am not working, but I acquired my first canvassing position in late May 2011. This position gave me the opportunity to identify myself as a political activist. Some independent expenditures I have worked on include: We Are Wisconsin, For Maryland Jobs and Schools, and The Mobilization Project, etc. I also worked with current Mayor Michael Venezia on his mayoral campaign.','As a member of the blind community I understand that over eighty percent of all blind individuals in the United States are unemployed. I feel that it is my duty to take what I will here and be able to teach other blind people I know as well as anybody else who would like to learn.','I hope to continue and excel in grassroots campaigning.','My stepfather, who is now a retired Chief Petty Officer in the United States Navy, taught me about justice. He taught me that suppressing any one persons life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness, is no justice at all.','I am hopeful that in the future I will take these skills and be able to apply them to some other blind individuals that one day will be able to work for me.','I would like to ask my boss, Ryan, to be a mentor to me because he was the only person to give me the opportunity to work. He saw my blindness as a challenge, rather than a roadblock.','I currently mentor my fiancé, Lea. By catapulting her outside of her comfort zone she is becoming more confident within herself.','One of my bosses, Danny, uses a hard-nosed style of management and leadership. I admire his \"no-nonsense\" approach to management, while keeping the integrity of the program. I am a very common sense person and it\'s fascinating to see his technique implemented.','Education vs. Nature from Plato\'s Cave Allegory. Knowing what is right is good. Getting others around you to believe and understand what is right is a completely different challenge. Learning how to bridge education and nature is the greatest battle civilization has. In essence, I can\'t walk in to a room of canvassers and tell them, \"You can\'t eat or drink for 5 hours,\" but educating them and getting them to believe in the cause is most important.','A big problem in the blind community is not having someone, with good vision, always there to assist you.

After completing my business plan, I began the hunt to find a tech team. When you don’t speak tech lingo, finding the right person for the job can be a challenge. So I decided to take an acquaintances advice: “The moment you stop investing in yourself is the moment you have written off future dividends.”','After finishing the residency, I would like to help companies that currently only have a brick and mortar facet get “online.” Not all companies need such; therefore, a selection process prior to approaching company takes place. I am also interested in software engineering positions within an NGO. I take each day in stride. Tomorrow brings a new outlook on life.','My mother has taught me about justice by the way she raised me and my sisters. She loves us equally and unconditionally. We all have different talents and roles to play in this world. We also have different personalities. The best way of expressing justice is accepting yourself and others for who they are.','I focus on the things that I do best. I try perfect my talents and not worry about the talents of others. Injustice has been a result of jealousy. The grass is always going to be greener to some. I love myself and those around me regardless of the situations I have been place in. ','Mendis Brown- I lived with my aunt and her family for a year and a half during my college years. During that period, she bestowed so much inspiration unto me that she is probably unaware of. Without fail her alarm goes off at 5am and she begins her day like clockwork. It is a beauty to watch how success follows structure and will power. Even at 60 years old, if she wants to achieve something she goes after it. Nothing discourages her.','I am currently mentoring a close friend of mine. She was a year behind me in college and we became close as she honed her love for music, particularly reggae. She requested my assistance in navigating that world since I have a few connections back home in Jamaica. I have mentored her in the art of networking and how to carry yourself. It is not always about who you know but about who the person next to you knows. Therefore put your best foot forward daily.','My church\'s recent appointment Rev. Dr. Glycher Beach took the congregation by storm with the policy: everything is aired on the pulpit. In the church, like the workplace, there is a rumor mill. This rumor mill can create so much chaos that praise is no longer conducive. By discussing the issues within the church in an open forum, rumors are squashed before they start. In my day to day, I prefer to ignore hearsay and go straight to the source.','When told my work does not reflect my capabilities. It reminds me of my biggest problem: stretching myself too thin. My mother frequently says “learn when to say no Kris-Ann.” I can have a deadline approaching when a friend, family member or acquaintance asks for my help, and I say yes. In the process of helping someone else out, I place things that are of importance to me on the back burner. The time/energy needed to complete the task is already dispersed','The NY subway system is dated. It is quite frustrating to find out about problems affecting a subway line after being stuck for 15mins in between stops. People are often late for work when an alternate mode of transportation could have been used. When people are left in the dark, there is room for mistakes. The NY subway system is not accountable to its users.','I would develop an interactive Subway system map at each station that tracks and shows the locations of the trains. Dots representing each train move along the colored lines of the map indicating the different lines. To see how many minutes out or how many miles out a train is, the person using the system would select the train line and zoom into the location of inquiry.','I enjoy going out whether it is to a lounge or to a dance club with my friends. My primary reason to go out is for the music. With that stated, the Shazam app has started to frustrate me. Often times the song passes before I get to shazam it. The app takes forever to open then to load. Lastly you have to click the icon which then takes a while to figure out the song.','Family- It drives me crazy that the only time of year I see my famiy is during the holidays.“Each day is a gift that’s why it’s called the present.” Therefore, I try to connect with someone close to me every day because it might be my last or theirs. Working out- I gained 55lbs while I was in college. In the moment as I swallowed each calorie, I didn\'t see my sense of self disappear until it was fighting for survival.

In terms of computing I know the C++ language.','There are various communities that have been excluded from the tech industry including women, LGBTQ individuals, people of color, indigenous groups, undocumented peoples and most certainly individuals who have little to no access to education. I am an undocumented, first-generation, Latino, UCLA math graduate who has lived and continues to witness discrepancies existent within U.S. society. I also try to challenge these discrepancies in a critical manner.','Currently I am working as a research assistant at UCLA under the supervision of Laura Enriquez, a sociology doctoral student. Most of the work consists of outreaching to possible interviewees, conducting interviews, transcribing interviews, coding interviews, analyzing data, and writing synthesized reports on my findings.  Most of the data analysis itself can be done from a portable computer. ','I recognize that technological advances in computing and other fields can further develop social movements for the purpose of obtaining social change. Hence, this training will allow me to gain a further understanding of coding platforms necessary to take the immigrant rights\' movement to the next level and at the same time enable me to learn about other pressing issues around the nation. ','I plan to work as a researcher within a community organization, possibly doing data analysis. I was fortunate enough to meet a student at Claremont Graduate University that is teaching me statistics and has told me of a couple of organizations that would possibly take me in. However, I acknowledge that having coding and statistics skills is a major plus when working with community organizations. ','A real person who taught me about justice is Sofia Campos, an Urban Planning masters student at MIT. I had the opportunity to meet her personally throughout my college years, organize alongside her, and work with her in Freedom School. She taught me about collective action, different policies, lobbying, and grassroot organizing among many other things. One lesson in particular that I carry on is the importance of creating global change via local action.','The way I have put Sofia\'s lesson into practice can be seen as early on in my first undergraduate research project at UCLA, dealing with Culturally Relevant Mathematics. I looked at different teaching practices being carried in the community (locally) to challenge U.S. curricula and academia (globally). Likewise, in my current work I study the racialized experiences of undocumented individuals to understand and formulate critical analysis of these.','I would like to ask professor Megan Franke, UCLA Math Education, to mentor me given her expertise in the subject and possibly guide me in conducting research in that field. ','I am currently mentoring three students, from Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, Nancy Menzilla, Martha Martin, and Luis Gomez. All of these students have asked me to mentor them as they need support in different things such as personal life, math assignments, scholarships, and college interests. I mentor them by relying on their previous knowledge, never assuming they don\'t understand the situation. It\'s a learner-center based educational lens. ','I admire my friend Diego\'s leadership style as he knows how to network, create a plan of action, laugh between sessions, and still get down to business. However, he places a lot of stress on himself at times as he feels the need to take up more than others. While I really enjoy networking and having fun at the same time I recognize that delegating stuff to myself and others is healthy for me since it reduces stress.','One marvelous piece of constructive criticism that I have received was \"less talking more doing.\" I received this from my guitar instructor when I was telling him about my vision for a business. I rambled on about how socially equitable it would be and the type of labor practices I would have in my business. I tend to get really theoretical at times. Luckily, he pointed out that I should get to it before the idea ceased and so I let the thought sink in.   ','A major problem in the immigrants rights\' movement deals with the disconnectedness of actions and outcomes of those actions held by different groups. In order to solve the disconnectedness there needs to be a universal platform (an app definitely) that educates people about actions happening around their community and their results. This would prompt inter-organizational, inter-generational, and intercommunal action outside organizers\' immediate circles.','In this application people would be able to browse, share, inquire, and attend a specific action. However, users could also enter data about actions they are having and possibly outreach for unfulfilled volunteer positions. However, the real catch is in the outcome of the action where users can feel even more connected to the cause by realizing what their efforts achieved. ','One app that I use is google maps, which displays traffic, bus stops, and more. However, one thing that I see missing is the display of \"major\" events happening around a traveller\'s route. This again could be used to the advantage of organizers and event enthusiasts of all sorts. This addition could help organizers outreach to a broader support base and potentially create long lasting networks with neighboring centers and businesses (purchases, etc.).

With my training provided by Code for Progress, I could provide the doctors who otherwise would not embrace new technologies open their practices','I have always considered being a veterinary technician, but with my new training, I could help a wider bandwidth of low-income citizens find affordable pet care than simply helping a few pets a week. ','When I was younger, my Aunt married a man of Mexican decent. Our family is African American and they weren\'t exactly happy about my aunt\'s new husband. I didn\'t understand why everyone was so mad until I heard them talking. Being an unfiltered child, I went to my aunt and told her what everyone was saying. She then told me that it will never matter that someone is different than you in any way. If you like their spirit, lean in closer. ','Since my aunt explained to me to gravitate towards differences, I try to make a point to get to know people that do not look like me, sound like me, or practice the same faith. I get excited learning new things from different people. This world is huge and only a few of us are lucky enough to see all of it. Since, for the moment, I am constrained to the U.S., I should utilize my resources and see the unseen parts of world in all of the people around me.','I would ask Elisabeth Omilami. SHe is the Director of the Atlanta charity Hosea Feed the Hungry and Homeless. Her father, Hosea Williams, founded the charity that feeds the homeless around the city of Atlanta. I would choose Ms. Omilami because she was raised by a man who recognized a need in the community and chose to tackle it with the limited resources he had. She continues his legacy and gives selflessly for the benefit of others. ','I let my sister and niece move in with me. My sister is a young single mother who unfortunately was not ready to be a mother. When I see her get frustrate with my niece for simply being a child, or when I see the mistakes that a young mother who does not know any better, I want to teach my niece about a different reality that exist. I teach her to be a good person over being a pretty girl. I teach her about money, credit, and to chase her creativity. ','Although I cannot think of a specific person, I admire any leader who takes risks. I am a very calculated person and all of my decisions are informed and well prepared in advance. I admire anyone who can let go of any doubt and just move in the direction that they feel at the moment. This is a skill I am working hard to develop. ','Living in a rigid world of Yes or No and Black and White, it was great to hear from a music producer that the music i wrote was was not bad. This person could have told me that what I wrote wasn\'t good but they told me that it wasn\'t what he was looking for. He then pointed me in a direction where my talents could be best utilized and where I could also develop what I had to offer rather than conforming to what everyone else was doing.  ','As a pet owner and as someone who has fallen on hard financial misfortune, I realize that many people take pet care for granted. Many low income/unemployed citizens cannot afford pet care and are thus forced to abandon their pet(s), give them to a shelter, or euthanize them. If there were an affordable alternative to pet care that were accessible to all income levels, euthanization would decrease and the cities could better control the pet population.  ','When low income people search for pet care, there is usually a clinic with a care rate that is 5% cheaper than a full priced veterinarian. With my app, users could enter their income/expenses and they would be directed to the nearest clinic that could cater to their income bracket. All information would have to be verified to prevent fraud, but this would deliver help to the people who really need it. ','I am an iPad user and I really believe that Aplle would have no competition if their innovative device simply had a usb port. Many people who use iPads or any tablet are on the go and do more than surf the net.Many users simply did not purchase the ipad because of the lack of this feature. I believe if Apple improved this feature they would take over this part of the market and steal Windows\' customer base to dominate.

In this career field, it is not enough to know how to design learning experiences but also to know how to design the TECHNOLOGY used for said learning experiences.The Code for Progress training will give me a tremendous leg up in the area and will allow me to stand out from the rest of the pack. Also, the knowledge I gain is something I can teach to others who are less fortunate.','I plan to look for employment that will allow me to combine my knowledge of instructional design with my newly acquired knowledge of web and mobile development, preferably in the role of an e-learning specialist or content developer.','I learned a lot about justice from a Sociology professor (and mentor) in college. He caused me to question everything I thought I knew about right and wrong and taught me to value all people no matter their differences. He also encourage me to challenge the status quo and never settle for \"That\'s just the way things are\" as an answer to anything. He was also never afraid to get involved in social issues on campus.','I take his teachings with me daily as a reminder to honor and respect all human beings as equals. This attitude is what brought me to my job at an after-school program in an inner-city school. I wanted to help students who were otherwise told that the odds were against and that they didn\'t have anything special to give to world. I also try to volunteer whenever I have time as I learned from him how important it is to be an agent of change in the community.','I would like to ask Dr. Heather Garten, a local community figure, to mentor me. Dr. Garten took a leap of faith and left the corporate world she knew to start SexySTEM, where she coaches individuals on how to use STEM to enhance their lives and achieve their dreams. I admire Dr. Garten\'s drive, passion, altruism, and optimism. It is so evident that she loves her work and is dedicated helping others.','In my after-school program job, I am mentoring a young woman named Jessica who is not doing very well in school. However, she is extremely kind and has a wonderful love and gift for visual art. I often find her hiding her drawings, embarrassed and convinced that they are no good. I try to teach her confidence and pride in her work and remind her that she is, indeed, special.','I highly admired the leadership style of a former boss. She was a very hands off person, but always stepped in when needed and wouldn\'t hesitate to give someone a few stern words if they didn\'t perform up to expectations. My leadership style differs from hers in that I like being hands on. I like getting rolling my sleeves up and being present BEFORE being asked to step in. I like others to know that I am always available.','In a previous job, I was told that, even though my work was exceptional, I needed to learn how to delegate responsibilities and ask for help when needed. I was always convinced that I needed to do it all in order to prove myself, but when I allowed others to help, I felt such a huge burden lifted from my shoulders. I also learned to appreciate other people\'s talents. It was a humbling experience.','I find that it is hard for people to find healthy foods that are also affordable. Obesity and other health problems have become commonplace in low-income areas, mainly because healthy foods can be expensive. ','I would make an app similar to Gas Buddy and Healthy Out that allows people to search through healthy foods in area grocery stores and compare prices. The app would use GPS technology to determine grocery stores close to that individual, allow a user to search through common health food items (ex: canned and frozen vegetables, produce, etc.), and presents results in order from cheapest to most expensive.','Currently in the Nashville Public Library system, library cards have to be scanned for different services: checking out books, using the Internet, printing, etc. In one short library trip, I scan my card at least three times, which can be pretty annoying if I\'m short on time. It would be great if there was a way that people would only have to use their cards ONCE per visit and still perform all of the services they need.','One thing I spend a lot of time on is reading. I\'m very passionate about learning and feel like, as long as there is no intent to harm, no knowledge is useless. Another thing I spend a lot of time on is cooking. I love the feeling of taking small, individual ingredients and creating a meal. The last thing I spend a lot of time on is finding and listening to music, one of my passions.

','I think a lot about how I can work toward social change with integrity. There always seems to be a gap between the ideas that I have and my abilities to bring those ideas into reality: a nagging doubt about the execution.

I work with a great activist who works really hard at building movements and developing bonds with people and it\'s a leadership style that I\'m not good at but that I think is necessary.','I tend to look at the bigger picture: how systems interact and what the end results are. It\'s really important to remember how things ought to be - how we should organize a just society - at this macro level. But small battles that still promote change are important, and a friend once told me we need to fight battles small enough to win and big enough to matter. I\'ve taken this to heart.','It\'s difficult for people understand social problems and how those problems effect their daily lives and little agreement on how best to address them. The end result is that there is little will to address crises that continually cause suffering.','It would allow people to collaborate on understanding social problems and developing solutions for those problems. It would also illustrate relationships between issues in helpful ways. We have Wikipedia for information, and I think we need a well-structured hub for discussing ideas and solutions.

While I\'d caution that a smartphone app wouldn\'t be a panacea for the city\'s problems (and that it wouldn\'t be a substitute for 911), one could use it to report incidents of street harassment, homeless people in crisis, elderly people that need help, etc.','I spend my time working on a political advocacy campaign that I care about, working at a progressive and community-focused bike shop, and reading and thinking about how to build a more just and equitable society.

I have another part time job as a media director in a no-profit pro-immigrant organization called National Pursuit of Dreams. I would like to take the training to help better these organizations especially here in the Central Valley where we need better applications for organizations.','This training will help me to create applications when it comes to outreach.

',' Reynaldo Leon, he is the director of the organization Valley Latino Environmental Advancement Project. I learned many things especially about environmental justice. I learned that ej is one important thing for the community because it advocate for the people are not well represented in the community, which means the people that are poor, or minority, in the Central Valley Ca.','I am more involved with the community. I have attended public meetings. I had been involved in forums where I give information about what is going on in the community and most important informing the community in order for them to take actions and advocate for a better place to live. ','Reynaldo Leon is the person that I will ask to mentor me. Because he has experience working in the community also because he is great leader.','I am currently mentoring my brothers and some of my cousins. I am the first in the family that graduated at a university and they always come to me. I help them on how to do better at school. I have two brothers that are going to a university and I share my experiences with them and advice them what to do when they have an obstacle.','I admire Pablo Reyes because he is very patient with people and motivates them. My leadership is a little different I am more committed and I like to work with those people that are committed to their responsibility.','One that I received from my peer in which he comment on one of the event that we had. I needed to plan more in order to have a better result because we did not reach our goal that was have a certain amount of people. ','Information accessibility; one of the things that as community organization we do not have in hand. Currently there are many studies about the issues cause by air pollution in the central valley. However, we would like to have that data in a place where anyone who wants to access to this data would be able to do that. At the moment we have to look for it and sometimes is not easy to find and organizations have to use their resources to make those studies.','When some wants to know how much is increased or decrease in air pollution in the Central Valley people will find scientific studies also what are the illness cause by air pollution and which cities are most affected or which part of the community.','The Hangout app. I use this app for online conference and every time I open the app in my phone it shows me the hangouts that I already had by default. It will be better if instead of showing the last hangouts made, actually load all of your contacts that are online in order to create a new hangout. Also the user interface should could be improved.

I think I do okay with it.','I am a Black, Gay, HIV positive male. With the exception of being Male, I find the rest of my various communities have absolutely (and currently are being) been excluded from the tech industry.','I currently work as an unpaid activist and as State Lead for Get EQUALNV. I lead our efforts here in Nevada to build bridges between various communities that have not had much interaction with one another in the state. Currently we are launching, #TalkingWhileBlack, a monthly event and discussion series. In February we are hosting a townhall on Immigration and the Black community with Congressman Steven Horsford (D-NV).','I am hoping that I will be able to come back after the training and teach others in my community how to use these tools to further the agenda of equality and self reliance.','I hope to be self employed. I have a strong belief in the power of the self employed American. Small business is the backbone of this country and I would like to be a part of that tradition. I want this business to be communications related as I will go into further into this questionnaire.','My uncle, Reverend Gil B. Lloyd, gave me my very first book, \"Colored Heroes.\" He always told me stories of the civil rights movement of which he was a participant. My uncle always had me sit next to a large white woman who wore a pendleton shirt and had very short hair every Sunday in his church, Cherry Hill Baptist. He said, \"she, and the congregation, need to know she is family and welcome here.\" Only as an adult did I realize she was a Lesbian. ','Everything I do is based on my uncle and how he would handle a situation. I never allow myself to allow negative forces to enter into my mind when I am focused on solving a problem or helping someone. I fight against injustice because of him. I believe in people and the power to right wrongs because of uncle Lloyd. I teach others about him and try to give a little of him to everyone.','I am so honored to have some amazing mentors. Cleve Jones, Ann Northrop, Babs Siperstein, Congressman Steven Horsford and so many others have been and are my mentors. I really don\'t have anyone that I wish was a mentor. If I did I would contact them and ask them if they would mentor me.','I am so proud of my friend Christopher Preciado. He followed me as Stonewall Democrats of Southern Nevada Chairman. He is 21 year old young man who I am thrilled to say has become one of the most well respected young people in Nevada politics and LGBTQ activism. I give him my life experiences ,but, much more importantly, I give him responsibilities and tasks that he has completed with flying colors. ','I love the way Barack Obama handles his business. He compromises, up until a point, then lets the hammer down when he\'s done dealing with fools. He gets it done Obama style. I tend to look at everything as a WWII battle plan. That could mean the scorched earth of Dresden or a hearts and minds campaign. I am more a general who trusts his troops to go out and win the battle based on my battle plans.','A pimp (of all people) gave me probably the best rules to live by: Never argue your case while angry. Never put yourself in a win / lose situation. Never align yourself with martyrs. I was guilty of all of the above. Once I changed over to this way of thinking, I became a successful activist. It\'s really common sense, as is most good advice.','89106 is our poorest and Blackest zip code. I recently canvassed it and every single person told me they had no hope that things would ever be better. That breaks my heart. How can a person have no hope? If they\'ve never seen anyone around them have success, of course they don\'t have hope of anything getting better. I know that one success in their community will grow a garden of not just hope, but, change. ','I see that folks in 89106 may not have computers, but, they do have cell phones. I would create a way for people to become entrepreneurs through their phones. Why not have cell phone based record labels or online poetry slams, etc..? They could use their cells to arrange rides for seniors to get to healthcare appts or connect students with tutoring by mentors from around the world. Anything is possible, and the tool is right there in everyone\'s hand.','I would like to see Google Hangouts made much more user friendly. It is such a great idea but not intuitive. You have to look for how to join a hangout which gets so frustrating. I have yet to have a drama free experience with it and I REALLY want to use it more to communicate with like minded people around the world. ','I walk around instagramming my city, Las Vegas @vegasstyleguy. I lead various political efforts that benefit the LGBTQ and Black communities. I also just enjoy being me and hanging out with me. Okay, guilty pleasures, the Kardashians, HGTV (don\'t judge me) and men\'s fashion.','3','5','5','5','4','2','5','5','2','None','None','None',NULL,'2','1','1','1','1','1','Katie','Vander Ark','amanda@catalystcreativ.com','206-909-6763','Katie has been a great guide for me and a life changing influence through her organization, Catalyst Creative.

to obtain his bachelors along with his brother. I believe that a lot of my family only knows the basics of a computer or tech and I would love the opportunity to improve my knowledge, so I can share it with others.','At the moment I am not working but have been working full-time for the past 2 years in a variety of fields including the Mortgage industry, Restoration industry, and general customer service.','This training will help me gain key skills in a exponentially growing world of technology to teach, grow, and build communities that do not have these skills present. ','The type of employment that I will be looking for is a career that will have meaningful impact on lives in a positive way. I have always be interested in green technology and I believe that self-sufficient world is a healthy, so I would like to use the skills learned in helping to develop programs that would benefit clean energy. ','My father taught me about justice and what is right and wrong. He taught me about being fair and about working hard for what you want. With hard work and determination you can go far and that is justice for your hard work. ','The ideas and concepts my father has taught me I used them to help start a small business, continue going to school, and marry the girl of my dreams. ','The person I would like to mentor me is Patrick McConlogue. Mr. McConlogue approached a homeless man on the streets of New York by the name of Leo Grand and taught him how to code and create an application called Trees for Cars. ','I am currently mentoring my little brother in the concepts that my father has taught me. I am trying to teach my brother in how to become a young man and figure out his purpose in life, what his passions are and go for them.','A person of leadership that I admire is my older brother. His leadership is different than mine because he is my analytical and more reserved. As I am more bold and straight to the point at times, he likes to weigh more options.','An excellent piece of constructive criticism I have received is not to be so critical of oneself. In the end it is you inside of your own head and its up to you to make yourself happy. ','One problem that is an epidemic in my community is the knowledge of things that do not matter. Straight out of high school young-adults are expected to contribute and be a helping part of society, but do not know how because they just sailed through high school learning concepts they will never use in their life. I want to create a program that helps young-adults make wise decisions with financials, higher education, and overall better moral choices.','First landing page would be your info, your goals, and what you\'re doing to make those goals complete. The next page would go into depth of how to save money effectively, avoid debt, and continue to make a change. The last page would be a plan or strategy to pay off your college education before or right after you graduate. ','One system that I use on a daily basis is Microsoft Office. One way that it could be improved is that it turn away from subscription based service and stay true to a one time buy situation.

I shared what I know about the political orientations of groups he might be interested in joining. I have periodically invited him to demonstrations and reading groups that are happening. I attended a protest against the threatened bombing of Syria with him and advised him on what to wear and what to bring.','Since today is Martin Luther King Jr Day, I will invoke him. He had a charismatic leadership style that was very effective at galvanizing people. To the extent that I am a leader, I lack charisma and can only lead by example. I admire most, however, that he coupled that with a willingness to be on the front lines, to get thrown into jail cells, and to take unpopular stances, even when it might threaten his established reputation and following.','\'Project your voice, provide visuals, use anecdotes and humor.\' In the course of giving public speeches on topics like Darfur and the Gaza strip I have learned much from those who have critiqued my talks. The most helpful criticisms were not only accurate but came coupled with suggestions for how to fix the problem; since they were empathetic, it was easy to avoid a defensive response.','The D.C. Medicaid providers directory, available in print and online, is static and the information is not current. This creates a barrier to obtaining healthcare. It becomes unnecessarily difficult and time consuming to find a care provider. Many offices must be called to find one accepting new patients. Further, if the user is not intimately familiar with street names in the District, it is difficult to determine accessibility of a provider location.','Many providers listed as accepting new patients are not in fact doing so, meaning the database is not being updated in a timely fashion. An online profile could be updated by provider offices directly, feeding into a db. Locating a provider that is conveniently near home or a workplace can be difficult as provider addresses are merely listed in no geographical order; there should be an option to sort the directory by proximity to a user inputted address.','I rely upon Google Maps and Navigation and local transportation web services to navigate transportation along novel routes in a city. Google Maps is very helpful for locating nearby bus stops. However, the bus schedules are frequently out of sync with other schedule information. The schedules databases need to be updated more frequently or at least the last updates should be date stamped and supplemented with local service information numbers and URLs.','Working on current affairs commentaries and related writing projects and following the news; attending meetings and protests; playing board games with friends.','5','5','5','4','5','3','4','5','3','5','3','1',NULL,'4','3','1','3','1','2','Connie ','Smith','csmith@hsph.harvard.edu','617-432-3414','She was my former supervisor','Jenna ','McElroy','mcelroy.jenna@gmail.com','302-354-4644','Coordinated my volunteer efforts at School of the Americas Watch','William ','Leung','wkleung@gwu.edu','202-994-8033','Recruiter at George Washington University ',1,'Bachelor\'s from University of Pittsburgh graduated 2005.','Friend',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1083,NULL,'6334Michelle','Michelle','Lujan','michlujan13@gmail.com','480-399-1153',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1084,NULL,'Hobby6110','Christelle','Hobby','clhobby412@gmail.com','480-773-3475',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1085,NULL,'Austin5932','Austin ','Mcgrath','austin@ieservices.info','602-872-6826',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1086,NULL,'7840Connie','Connie ','Smith','csmith@hsph.harvard.edu','617-432-3414',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1087,NULL,'Jenna6242','Jenna ','McElroy','mcelroy.jenna@gmail.com','302-354-4644',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1088,NULL,'1904William','William ','Leung','wkleung@gwu.edu','202-994-8033',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1089,NULL,'talented1','Cavaughn ','Noel','cavaughn@gmail.com','9738181670','266 West 139th St','New York','NY','10030','1.
